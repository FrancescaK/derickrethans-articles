The past couple of days I've been speaking at `php|tropics`_ in Cancún, Mexico.
It might not be the first place that you could think of for organizing a
conference as attendees might find the pool and the free drinks more
intesting than going to the conference sessions.

The flight to Cancún went fine - `Continental`_ is pretty okay and
the second leg of the flight was actually rescheduled to 30 minutes
earlier, which caused that I didn't have to wait at all in Newark.
Getting into the US was a bit annoying as usual and I think that taking
finger prints and a photo makes people feel like they're criminals.
Arriving at Cancún International Airport is interesting too - after
passing through immigration and customs there is a horde of people that
want to arrange "transportation" for you. I respectfully
declined and waited for `Chris`_ , `Wez`_ and `George`_ and shared
a "taxi" with them to the `Moon Palace Resort`_ .

The conference started the next day on the 12th in the Expo Center
across the road from the resort's entrance. The first talk I had to give
was on "Clustering PHP and MySQL". It was the first time that
I gave this talk, but it worked out fine although I should have had a
tiny bit more material. After the sessions ended we went for dinner in
one of the many restaurants and relaxed at the pool-side.

On the second day of the conference I had no talks to give, and together
with `Ilia`_ and `Andrei`_ we booked a tour to `Chikin-Ha`_ .
We had several activities on this tour, like zip-lining, snorkling in an
under ground river and enjoying Maya food. Definitely a better choice
than staying at the hotel doing nothing all day. `Andrei`_ has more on this trip. When we returned we headed for the hotel's pool
and enjoyed the sun and water while sipping on our
cocktails.

On the third day of the conference I gave two talks. One was a
"Bring Your Own Laptop" session on "Practical Debugging
Techniques" in which I showed how to use `Xdebug`_ and the second one was on
"Encryption with PHP".

When checking in to get out of Mexico I found out that I misplaced my
immigration card, so I had to get a replacement at the immigration
office. When walking there I was already blaming myself for this, and
worrying about how much time this was going to cost. Fortunately, the
woman in the office gave me a simple form that I had to fill in, and
during the 30 seconds that that took me she was hapily singing along
with the radio. So as soon as that was wrapped up, I could go home
through the air via Newark where it was again a chaos with endless
queues for the various attractions like immigration, bagage collection,
customs, bagage re-check-in and security. So much for efficiency. I did
make it on time to Schiphol airport where I had a pick-up that brought
me back to my parents place. Next trip is to go back home to Norway on
Saturday.

The presentation slides of my three presentations on " `Xdebug`_ ", "Clustering `PHP`_ and `MySQL`_ " and "Playing Safe: PHP
and Encryption" are online at the `talks page`_ .
