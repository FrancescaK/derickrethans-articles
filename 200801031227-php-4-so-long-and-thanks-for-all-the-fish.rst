PHP 4 is no more, with the last `PHP 4.4.8 release`_ the end as come. In the past eight years PHP 4 provided
people a web-focussed language, solving many web-related problems. Since
a few years a much improved version has `slowly been taking over`_ market share from PHP 4 - now at more than 25%.
We, the PHP core developers, want to put our development power on the
future technologies. Because of this, we will no longer support PHP 4
with the exception of possible releases addressing security issues until
2008-08-08.

PHP 5, especially PHP 5.2 and later, offers a much more stable, faster,
and feature-rich web application development environment. We would
therefore recommend to upgrade as soon as possible, especially now PHP 4
support does no longer exist.

Now all that's left is a homage to PHP 4:

::

	So long and thanks for all the fish
	So sad that it should come to this
	The future belongs to those who dare.
