After almost four years of work, Xdebug 2 is finally ready. With
improved functionality and many new features it is ready to totally
change the way you develop in PHP. Some of the new features and updates
include `improved stack traces`_ , `execution traces to files`_ , `code coverage analysis`_ and much improved `remote debugging`_ support.
Xdebug's `documentation`_ has also
been rewritten for more clarity.

As with most open source projects, it's very hard to know who are
actually the users of the project. As I would like to know my users
better, I would invite everybody who finds Xdebug useful to send me a
postcard with their location. (Address is `here`_ at the top of the page). I am looking
forwards to find out who you are!

Now head over to the `Xdebug`_ site and
try it out!
