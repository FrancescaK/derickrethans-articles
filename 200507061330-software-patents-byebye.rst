So, it seems that the European Parliament did the only correct thing
today. They voted massively against the proposed directive
"Patentability of Computer Implemented Inventions Directive".
648 voted against, 14 for and there where 18 abstenstions. Now the
European Commision has to restart the whole process, if they are going
to do this at all.
