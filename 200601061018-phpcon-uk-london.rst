On Friday the 10th of February 2006 I will be presenting a talk on the `eZ components`_ at
the `PHPCon`_ in London. In `this talk`_ I will explain the structure, contents and workings of the eZ
components library. It should give a good overview of its architecture
and at the same time give you an introduction on how to use the
components. This conference is extremely cheap (Â£50) and there is a
good `line up`_ of speakers. If you have time, please `join`_ !
