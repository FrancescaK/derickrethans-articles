Yahoo! Search recently changed their front page to include three of "Earth's
Biggest Puzzles". As a long time user I find this really obnoxious especially
because there doesn't seem to be any way to turn this off. So I decided to do
something about it and I wrote a Greasemonkey_ script to get rid of it again.
You can find the script here_.
