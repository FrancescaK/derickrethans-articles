The last week has been a bit crazy because of the `eZ publish`_ conference. The whole week was packed with all kinds of
activities.

Now that life returned to normal busyness I managed to recover my photos
from New York. (I wiped them off my memory card... which is not smart).
The photos from the New York trip are `here`_ .

During last week there were several different events as well. On Tuesday
we had a crew day where I for the first time met *all* of my
collegues. And the last weekend there was `PHP Vikinger`_ - an unconference
about PHP related things.

All events were very succesful. Photos can be found `here`_ .
