By now most you will probably have heard of the term "NoSQL". It's a vague
term that collects lots of different types of database engines. The main
classes of "NoSQL" databases are "Key/Value stores", "Column databases",
"Graph databases" and "Document databases". Examples of a Key/Value stores
are memcache_ or Redis_, where data can only be stored and retrieved through a
specific key. "Column databases", such as Cassandra_ and Hadoop_ are great
for processing large amounts of data; and "Graph databases" such as Neo4j_ and
OrientDB_ model the *relations* between entities. `Apache CouchDB`_ and
MongoDB_ belong to the last category, "Document databases".
