Last Saturday (June 9th) was the second installment of `PHP Vikinger`_ , a PHP un-conference.
Just like the previous year a group of about 30 people from many
European countries attended and shared their PHP knowledge.

I collected the slides of the "presentations" for most of the
talks. We had a talk on `MySQLND`_ by Andrey Hristov, one on
PHP 6 migration (by me, no slides), one on creating images with PHP (by `Kore Nordmann`_ ), one on `The Age Of Literate Machines`_ (by `Zak`_ ) and a short introduction to `Xdebug`_ by me again.

A delegation from `PHP Norge`_ , the
Norwegian PHP User group, also video-taped some of the presentations.
Their recordings can be found on their `web site`_ . Other links to PHP
Vikinger coverage: `Bjarte S. Karlsen`_ and `Knut Urdalen`_ .
