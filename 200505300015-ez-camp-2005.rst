Next weekend I will be presenting on Clustering and Caching at the `eZ publish Camp`_ . In this session I
will talk about our new static cache features in eZ publish 3.6 and how
we've set-up our cluster. The Camp will be at the foot of `Gaustablikk`_ ,
Telemarks heighest mountain.

Besides the conference this means some time to hike to the top, and take
some more pictures of the mountain, it's environment and `Rjukan`_ .
Unfortunately, there is no chance of registering anymore.
