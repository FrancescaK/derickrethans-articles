Today we had `annular solar eclipse`_ which was unfortunately not visible from my
location. Here we had a simple partial eclipse. As it is way to
dangerous to look directly into the sun to see it, I used a cardboard
square with a hole in it to project the sun's eclipsed disc on a
projection screen mode out of white paper. For more pictures, see `the gallery`_ .
