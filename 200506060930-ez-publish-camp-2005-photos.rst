Traveling in Norway always makes you see interesting and beautiful
scenery. The same was true during my trip to Gaustablikk for the `eZ publish Camp`_ .

On our way to Gaustablikk we drove past the `Heddal stavkirke`_ in Notodden - Norway's largest stavkirke. It's not as old as the one in `Urnes`_ ,
but still very typical.

The weather around the hotel was not very good. It was very foggy the
first two days. It did create an execellent atmosphere for taking
pictures. Together with Gunnstein and the `phpedit`_ guys we went on a small
hike around the nearby lakes.

At the last day Gaustablikk finally showed up after the mist evaporated
and plenty of people started photographing and `posing with it`_ .

On the sunday after the conference a group of us decided to walk to the
top of Gausta. Together with Ray, Gunnstein, Bj√∏rn, Frederik and Peter
I walked 2 hours and 45 minutes to the top in heavy snow (2 meters at
places). Although I was totally exhausted when I got back, it was really
worth going there.
