Next week I will be presenting several talks during the `International PHP Conference`_ . I
will present on two topics: `PHP 6 and Unicode`_ in which I explain the current short comings in
PHP's support for i18n and l10n and the new support for Unicode that
will be implemented for PHP 6; and `How PHP Ticks`_ in which I will explain some of the details on how PHP
works internally.

Besides those two talks I will also act as coach for the `PHP Lounge`_ . All of the three evens will happen on Tuesday November
8th.
