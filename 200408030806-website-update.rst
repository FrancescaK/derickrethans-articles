During my holidays I also spend some time updating my website so
that it is better "permalink"-proof.

The `front page`_ now always shows the last 24
articles and/or blurps. In case there is an article among those 24
items it is shown on the left side, and all blurps are then
positioned on the right side (like it was previously). In case
there is no article among those last items the blurps are devided
equally between the two columns. The last item is now highlighted
in a shade of blue.

The biggest change is in the `archive section`_ , where all articles are now ordered into the indexed
by month, and also shown by month. `Monthly`_ archive pages always shows
all the articles and blurps of that month, again equally divided
between the two columns. When an older blurp is `linked to`_ it is automagically highlighted, just like the last item
on the front page.

I think this new situation makes more sense as
it was impossible to link to old blurps on the site.
