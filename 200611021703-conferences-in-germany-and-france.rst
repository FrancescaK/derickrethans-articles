Next week I will be traveling to Frankfurt and Paris to attend and speak
at two conferences. On the first one in Frankfurt I will talk about the
new date and time functionality that is now finally generally available
with the release of PHP 5.2 and about the upcoming Unicode support in
PHP 6. In Paris I will have a talk at `Forum PHP`_ about the `eZ components`_ . Hope to see you
there!
