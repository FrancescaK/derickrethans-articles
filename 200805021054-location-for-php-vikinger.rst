We've now found a definite location for `PHP Vikinger`_ . It will be at one of
the old factory buildings here at `Klosterøya`_ , close to `eZ Systems'`_ offices. The room has about space
for 80 people, and has a nice view over the river southwards. About 20
people from Norway, Iceland, the UK, Germany and Denmark have signed up
so far. This means there is still plenty of space for you! See `http://phpvikinger.org`_ for more
information, and the `invitation`_ .
