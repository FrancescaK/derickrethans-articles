Some times people don't want to submit their code when filing a `bug report for PHP`_ because of "Legal Reasons". They simply assume we can fix it
even with their very `vague reasons`_ . Usually
we `persist`_ in
asking for more information because we're nice and want to help those
people who think they found a bug anyway. Sometimes this gives `hiliarius responses`_ .
Come on, your Ã¼ber-cool "new technology" with PHP - we're
that ones that gave you the tool to write your "new
technology" in the first place. Even better is when they claim that
"they're not allowed to tell you what it is".

But it gets, better - now the guy is `even offering`_ that we
debug his large application for us, but we need to sign an NDA as well
then. I'm not sure in which world this guy lives, but an NDA for a bug
report? :) If you can't make a short reproducable case, then you're
pretty much lost anyway. I just ended up asking `how much they pay`_ .
