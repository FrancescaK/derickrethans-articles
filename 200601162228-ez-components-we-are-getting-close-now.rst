Just a couple of hours
ago `we`_  `released`_ the first release candidate of the `eZ components`_ . The
components are the first step in porting `eZ publish`_ to PHP 5.

In this release we overhauled the way we are using Exceptions and
implemented them consistently in all the Components.

If you have the components already installed with the PEAR installer,
you can simply type:

::

	pear upgrade ezc/ezcomponents

and it will upgrade all the components to the rc1 versions. You can also
simply `download`_ the whole bundle.

If you have feedback, or questions, please use the `forum`_ .
