I just `released Xdebug 2.0.1`_ . This
version comes with a `few bug fixes`_ but the
main thing is greatly improved performance of Xdebug's `Code Coverage`_ functionality. To give an idea on what kind of improvement I'm talking,
I am including very rough benchmark results. For this benchmark I ran
the test suite of the `eZ Components'`_  `Graph`_ component without
code coverage checking, with Xdebug 2.0.0 and Xdebug 2.0.1. The results
are as follows:

::

	Without code coverage: 1m00s
	With code coverage, old Xdebug (2.0.0): 132m38s
	With code coverage, new Xdebug (2.0.1): 4m57s

That's quite something if you ask me :-)

When I `released Xdebug 2.0.0`_ , I
asked users (you!) to send me a postcard if you appreciate my work on
Xdebug. So far, I received (only) 19 of them. I put them online at `flickr`_ .
I am waiting for more ;-) (Address is `here`_ ).
