It keeps amazing me this weird phenomenem. I might be a local
thing, or even a national thing; I'm still not sure about it.
Those 'rånere' are driving around the city in their either fancy
cars, or cars with loud stereo over and over again, for what it
seems for no good reason. *shrug*, silly Norwegians.
