A
week ago PHP 4.4.0rc1 was `released`_ - this release
addresses major problems with references in PHP. But not many people are
fully aware of how variables and references actually work in PHP. This
is where my latest article in `PHP Architect`_ comes
into play. It explains in details how assigning variables, passing
variables to functions and returning variables from functions work -
both by-value and by-reference.
