Last week after returning from Frankfurt I continued my way to Paris to
speak about the `eZ components`_ at Forum PHP. You can find my slides online on the `talks`_ page as usual.

Besides the conference I also took the opportunity to travel to
Versailles, but unfortunately that was closed. Of course, some shots of
the Eiffel tour had to be taken. All photos that I took during the trip
can be found `here`_ .
