With the extreme amount of security holes in PHP applications it looks
like PHP is too blame. I don't agree with that statement as it's always
up to the developers of those `Great Project`_ to write solid applications, not PHP.

This does not mean that PHP can't offer better functionality to allow
users deal with input parameters more safely. Point #3 of `Rasmus' PHP 6 Wishlist`_ is a filter extension to replace the arcane input
handling functionality that is in PHP now. Although it's very flexible,
using input validation is still a fine art. With input from many others,
I wrote an RFC for the filter extension, which you can find online `here`_ .
We will also be using this in a library component for eZ publish, as
part of our Component library.
