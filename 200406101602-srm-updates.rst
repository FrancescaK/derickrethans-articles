Finally some time to work on `SRM`_ again. At `work`_ we're looking into using SRM for eZ
publish to speed up general initialization and object creation and
this required some more stability in SRM. And that's the reason
why I replaced the semaphore based locking with message queues to send and
receive events from the Bananas. More will follow!
