The UK House of Lords `passed a controversial internet piracy bill`_ that will
have great consequences for society. Not only because it wants to disconnect
file sharers, but also because of other privacy invading clauses. It is
possible (likely even) that this bill will be rushed through parliament without
a proper debate.  I therefore wrote to my MP to urge her to properly discuss
this in parliament. I am copying that letter below:

Dear Sarah Teather,

I've been following the recent developments around the Digital Economy
Bill and what I read worries me deeply. This law, spearheaded by the
Lord Manderson, is controversial in many ways. Now it seems possible
that this bill is going to be rushed to be signed into law without a
full Parliamentary debate.

There are several issues with this bill that I would like to address.
First of all, the proposed US-DMCA like practices that would allow
copyright holders to ask an ISP to take down content. ISPs will have
no choice, but to comply with those take-down notices because it would
be their legal responsibility. ISPs will have to fight out in court if
they want to prove that certain content is not infringing, and
obviously they will not have the inclination to do so on their
customers' behalf. This makes it relatively easy for anybody to demand
content taken off-line, whether they are the copyright holder or not,
or even without having to prove the content is in violation.

At the same time, the Digital Economy Bill will allow the use of
"orphaned works"â€”works for which the author is not easy to find. I am
a semi-professional photographer with many images published on the
Internet in various locations, some that are difficult to link me to
as an author. I expect this to be even more the case for people's
holiday pictures that they post to sites such as flickr and facebook.
I don't want my work to be used commercially without consent, but if
the Digital Economy Bill would be signed into law, corporations could
use anyone's family pictures without their consent. This is of course
in full contrast with other proposed clauses that criminalize
copyright infringements where the copyright is owned by large (mostly
not even UK) corporations.

As you can see, there are measures in this Bill that concern me, and
so I think that it deserves proper scrutiny. Please don't let the
government rush it through. I, and many of my peers, think it will
damage schools and businesses as well as innocent people who rely on
the internet because it will allow the Government to disconnect people
it suspects of copyright infringement with any due process.

I am writing to you today to ask you to do all you can to ensure the
Government doesn't just rush the bill through and deny us our
democratic right to scrutiny and debate. I would be happy to discuss
this matter with you further and provide some examples.

Yours sincerely,
Derick Rethans

I have not seen a reply yet, but will update this post in case I receive one
later. Please also write to your MP in case you are concerned with how this
bill will affect your privacy and rights.
