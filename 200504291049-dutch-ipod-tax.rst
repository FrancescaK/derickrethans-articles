The Dutch "Stichting Thuiskopie" got totally out of their
mind. They're proposing to tax digital music players with €3.28 per GB
because they can be used to store *pirated* music. I've always found the
tax on empty CD stupid as hell because it also taxes people who just use
empty CDs to make backups - but asking €3.28 per GB is a bit too
bloody much. Especially also because if you buy music from iTunes, you
already *pay* for the copyright.

This so-called tax is to compensate "artists" for people who
make copies of copyrighted works but this same organization claims it's
illegal to copy... really really strange. See also the article at `The Register`_ .
