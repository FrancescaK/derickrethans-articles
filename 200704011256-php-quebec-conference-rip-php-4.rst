A few weeks ago already I spend some time in Quebec (that's in Canada)
at the fifth conference organized by the `PHP User Group`_ there. As usual the
conference was great, and the pre-conference skiing trip was even
better. I always like going to Montreal, not only because of the cool
conference, but also because of all the extra events that are happening
there (which mostly involve (too much) alcohol). Some, but not all
pictures are `here`_ . At the
conference I gave a talk on Database Design and a talk on the input
filter extension in PHP. You can find the slides for both talks on my `talks`_ page.

During the closing keynote session the audience was asking the PHP team
/ speakers questions, and one of the questions was "When will you
stop support for PHP 4?". At that moment we couldn't really give an
answer, but now we finally can. Support for PHP 4 will be dropped at the
end of the year, 8 months from now. So now is the time to start
upgrading all your scripts as we won't be releasing new versions after
December 31st, 2007.
