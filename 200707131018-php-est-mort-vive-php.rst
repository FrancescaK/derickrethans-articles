On `April 1st`_ I
already wrote about the end of life of PHP 4 - more as a joke than a
real statement. It was April 1st after all. However, after a little `discussion`_ on the PHP Internals mailing list the development team actually reached
consensus in quite an amazing time. So now it is `official`_ -
support for PHP 4 will be dropped by the end of the year. That means
there are 172 days left to convert your applications to PHP 5 - good
luck!
