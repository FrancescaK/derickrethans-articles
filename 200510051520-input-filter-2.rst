A few weeks ago I already wrote about the `Input Filter`_ extension. After a quick
round of review I now implemented the `extension`_ as a `PECL package`_ so that
it can get some more testing. After this testing round the plan is to
put this extension by default in the PHP distributions.


.. _`Input Filter`: /input_filter.php

.. _`PECL package`: http://pecl.php.net/filter
