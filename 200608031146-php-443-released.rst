I just released PHP 4.4.3 which brings a number of security fixes (and
other fixes) that were backported from the PHP 5.1 branch. None of the
security issues are *very* critical, but it is a good idea to
upgrade anyway as you never know what clever ways people come up with
to try to hack your servers :)

For more information, see `the release announcement`_ and `The ChangeLog`_ .

This is not the last PHP 4.4 relase and the PHP team will continue to
support it for some years to come.
