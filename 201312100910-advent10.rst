I had previous managed to clear out all the discrepancies on ITO World's
Analysis for Camden_, `Kensington and Chelsea`_ and the `City of Westminster`_.
But I have so far not yet managed to address all of the issues in my home
borough Brent_. I guess this is mostly because the "issues" are not really in
the nicest parts of the borough—perhaps there are even dragons there. But I am
trying to make a point to get to them anyway, so I set out by bus to Dollis
Hill to tackle `Grunwick Close`_, `Flowers Close`_ and `St Andrews Close`_. 

The first one, Grunwick Close was a new road and I couldn't find any street
sign at all. I had to ask a local resident which indeed confirmed that I had
the correct street name. The latter two actually had a "FIXME" tag on them,
and no name tag. The first one, Flowers Close, was previously_ incorrectly
mapped as Flower Road (and OS Locator had it right), but the second one was
wrong on OS Locator as it had thought there was an apostrophe in "Andrews"—the
street sign disagreed.

The `platform at Dollis Hill`_ had this annoyingly nagging "FIXME" tag on it
and I couldn't let that go unfixed of course. (Did I mention OpenStreetMap is
addictive and that I have some form of OCD?) So I spend some time mapping all
the aspects of the tube station: entrances, tunnels, stairs, platforms, tracks
and stop positions—all following the "new" `public transport scheme`_. The
image here shows how the new station looks like on the map.
