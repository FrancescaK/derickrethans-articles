Through the `BBC News`_ website I heard about that the `Norway Tax Service`_ publishes on their website the annual income of all of
their tax payers. I was quite stunned by this as in my opinion this is
quite a breach of privacy. The newspapers are also `full of lists`_ that compare the incomes of specific groups of public figures. The data
is now only online for 3 weeks, but "next year's tax returns will
be published online, as per usual, but they will not be removed after
three weeks, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg's centre-left government
has signalled." Luckily the newspapers are not publishing my annual
income yet :) (and yes, you can find that on the net too).
