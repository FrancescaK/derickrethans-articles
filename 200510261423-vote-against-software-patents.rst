The European Union is currently running an internet poll for the
"European of the Year". The folks at `No Software Patents`_ give
you `a suggestion`_ how to vote if you're caring about (or actually
against) Software patents. Florian Mueller (who is leading the effort)
is one of the candidates, and a strong vote for him might elevate the
issue of software patents to the level of awareness that other major
political topics enjoy.
