About a months and a half ago Mozilla announced_ its `Location Services`_. It is
"an experimental pilot project to provide geolocation lookups based on
publicly observable cell tower and WiFi access point information". In other
words, it is going to provide a similar service as Google's location service
that Firefox currently uses for its `location aware browsing`_.

In order to provide this service, they need geolocated data so that they know
where WiFi access points and cell towers are. They have released a tool,
MozStumbler_, that allows everybody to collect this data and provide it to
Mozilla. I believe that there should be open alternatives for important
services like this, and I think that Mozilla seems like a good caretaker of
this data, respecting privacy. So I have installed MozStumbler_ and turn it on
whenever I go on a new route through town.

The application isn't the prettiest as you can see, but it does work well.
There is also a "Test Mozilla Location Services" which uses their API to
lookup the locationâ€”without using the GPS. Ichnaea_ is the public API that you
can use to do lookups yourself. The Geolocate_ API implements the same
interface as the `Google Maps Geolocation API endpoint`_. But there is a more
extensive Search_ API as well. I will soon be upgrading Haunt_ to use this new
API as the one it currently uses is discontinued.
