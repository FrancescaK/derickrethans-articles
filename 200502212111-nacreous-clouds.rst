I finally figured out what the name is of `the effect`_ that I photographed a
few weeks ago. (Sorry, Gunnstein, I found out over the weekend). It's an `Nacreous Cloud`_ , which is said to be quite a
rare effect which also `affects`_ the Ozone
layer unfortunately. More pictures (by others) can be found `here`_ .
