The `PHP Conference`_ in
Frankfurt is over, and I got safely (and without `problems`_ )
home. The conference was, as in previous years, well attended and
besides the normal sessions there were quite some other things going
on.

On Monday evening Marcus hosted a talk on `writing extensions`_ for PHP, where `Ilia`_ ,
Johannes and I assited attendees by solving extensions related
problems. There were little questions so instead I backported a fix to
PHP 5.1 regarding `Class typehints and = null`_ .

On Tuesday a few of the PHP developers (Marcus, Aaron, Ilia, me, and
others) were the main attraction. In the `PHP Lounge`_ attendees got the chance to discuss whatever PHP topic they
had on their mind with us coaches.

Now I'm home again, but only to sleep. Tomorrow morning I will be
heading to Paris to meet some other PHP developers to discuss the
Unicode support for PHP 6.
