This year `eZ systems`_ (the company that
rents my brain) will organise the 4th edition of their conference. This
year we broaden the scope a bit with an "Enterprise PHP"
track. For this track, and the others ( `eZ publish`_ and
"Enterprise CMS"), we are looking out for interesting
subjects.

If you think that you have a good subject, please have a look at our `Call for Papers`_ . The submission deadline for all proposals is January
16, 2006 and the conference will take place in Skien, Norway, from June
20-23, 2006.
