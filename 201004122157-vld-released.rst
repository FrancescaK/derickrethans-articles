I just released a new version of VLD_ through PECL_. This release features the
path analytics code that I've outlined in an `earlier article`_. There are also a
few fixes for PHP's current trunk, as well as the possibility to format output
slightly like a CSV file. That feature was used to make this_ documentation of
opcodes.

The path analysis algorithm that VLD_ now has, can possibly also be used to get
path/branch coverage working within `Xdebug's`_ code-coverage framework. This
is however not a minor task.
