Apparently it is not such a good idea to have a wrong name on your
ticket if you're flying somewhere. When printing my boarding pass
yesterday after checking in online I noticed that my lastname was
written as "Gerardus" (which is my official middle name) and
my real last name was missing. I called the service desk and a very
nice lady helped me getting my name changed to the correct one. She
told me to pick up my new ticket at the ticketing office at the
airport.

But when I got there there was something wrong ofcourse - there was no
ticket with my last name. Because I was a bit late the people behind
the counter were getting a bit nervous, but in the end they figured out
that my lastname was spelled wrong *again* , this time in the form
of Rathans. Finally when that was cleared up I could board the plane.

As I'm flying with `KLM`_ , the
stewardesses speak Dutch on board. It's always funny to listen into
their conversations as they not often expect many Dutch people on
board. The most interesting quote when encountering the *second* dutch person on board was (from the other stewardess ofcourse)
"What is it with all those Dutch people on this plane".
Atleast the Dutchies are not complaining about the flight not offering
alcoholic beverages, unlike the Norwegians on the plane ;-)
