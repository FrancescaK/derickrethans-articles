I am
proud to announce the most recent release of the eZ Components and would
like to thank the team and the contributors for their dedication in the
past few months. The new version of the `eZ Components`_ , 2006.2, comes with
three brand new components: `Graph`_ (pictured on the right), `SignalSlot`_ and `Url`_ .

Besides the three new components many of the other components have new
functionality as well. Most important are the new `IMAP`_ transport for the Mail component, which includes contributions by Mikko
Koppanen; better support for databases other than MySQL for the three
database components Database, DatabaseSchema and PersistentObject; and
support for `relations`_ in the PersistentObject component. For a full overview, please have a
look at the `release announcement`_ . You can download the eZ Components from `the download page`_ .

We are of course interested in your feedback in the form of either bug
reports or feature requests (but we prefer feature requests) which you
can file in our `issue tracker`_ .
The issue tracker also contains the `roadmap`_ to the next release. However, this roadmap has not been finalized yet.
