I wrote an e-mail to the editors of DevShed because of an article on DevShed:

Dear Editors,

I stumbled upon: `http://www.devshed...Conflict-PHP/`_ and I was wondering if you ever fact-checked
this article. I've never read so much bullshit about PHP in my life. How could you guys publish this? It's
even worse than `http://www.devshed...e-Owned-by-Sun/`_ which is
untrue in many ways too.

I don't really care about reading it, I just laugh about this much stupidity - but on the other hand people
that read this article might take it seriously, making PHP (and Zend) look extremely bad. Please consider
removing this non-sense article.

regards,
Derick
