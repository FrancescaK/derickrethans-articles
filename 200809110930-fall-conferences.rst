Fall is coming up, and the means plenty of conferences. Next week there
is `ZendCon`_ , where I will be
speaking on search solutions for PHP and Test Driven Development.

On September 27th I will be speaking on Debugging with Xdebug at the `Barcelona PHP Conference`_ .

At the `International PHP Conference`_ (no longer in Frankfurt^WMÃ¶rfelden, but in Mainz) I
will be speaking on PHP Myths Defused and `Xdebug`_ -- I will also give a keynote on
the "K.I.S.S." principle.

At `php|works`_ in Atlanta I
will speak on Test Driven Development and Xdebug, and at the last *planned* conference of the year, `PHP North West`_ I
will also give a keynote on the "K.I.S.S." principle.
