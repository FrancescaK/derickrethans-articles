Over the past two weeks I have been on a whirlwind tour to talk about Profiling
PHP Applications (at `PFCongres`_), but mostly about MongoDB_ at various (PHP)
user groups in the South West of the US. 10gen_ (the makers of MongoDB_ and my
employers) covered my time and flight, and provided me with some beer money.

The tour concept started a few months ago when `Ligaya Turmelle`_ suggested
that I should come and talk at the `JaxPHP/JaxWeb`_, the PHP and web developers
usergroup in Jacksonville, Florida. And while I was there, why not visit a few
other user groups too? So after my short trip to the Netherlands to speak at
PFCongres, I flew to Miami for the first stop of the MongoDB Tour.

To fight off jetlag I landed a day early and together with Adam Culp from
SoFloPHP_ we saw some of the sights there. Mostly, some wetlands and the beach.
Sadly, no alligators were spotted but it was a nice quiet day before the storm.

The user group meeting attracted over a dozen attendees and afterwards we had a
drink with a few of us. I was slightly surprised that not (almost) all of the
attendees joined us. However, it was good to catch up with Pablo from
ServerGrove_, even though I had met him in Utrecht the weekend before.

Adam then drove me to Orlando for the hand-off with David Rogers at the Florida
Mall. After doing some work, we also did the `Orlando PHP`_ user group meeting at
the mall, in the Microsoft Store (conveniently located next to the Apple
Store). Speaking in a store, with shopping public around was quiet a unique
experience. But I am not sure if I would repeat that. Also, they don't know
what a "loo" is there :-).

David then drove me to Saint Augustine for the hand-off with Ligaya. After an
afternoon of sight-seeing in the `oldest city`_ of the country, Lig and I
headed to the usergroup venue in the Adecco offices. The venue was a bit hard
to find, and sadly we lost some attendees because of that. However, the venue
was nice and besides the PHP users of `JaxPHP/JaxWeb`_, there were also a lot
of developers using alternative languages. My presentation was therefore
language-agnostic.  This was probably the group with the most questions asked!

Ligaya didn't want to make the 6-hour drive to Atlanta, so instead she put me
on a plane. After negotiating MARTA, Kevin Roberts picked me up from the station
and after a lunch and some work in the afternoon we headed to the user group
venue at Strongbox. The `Atlanta PHP`_ group is traditionally quite a bit larger but the
turn-out (compared to Meet-Up RSVPs) was a bit poor. Perhaps this was because
the meeting was on a Friday evening though. This talk was recorded (both video
and as screen capture).

On Saturday Kevin and Chris Spruck joined me on my travels to Nashville. Along
the way we did some sightseeing (Ruby Falls and Jack Daniel's distilery) and I
had my first encounter with Waffle House. A small party was planned for us in
the evening by Jacques to visit some of the Honky Tonks in town. I remember
being given many different Bourbons to taste. Cal was hosting me and together
with Kathy we ended up relaxing and having lunch at Loveless' Caf√©. In the
evening Cal had rounded up a bunch of locals (Jason Myers, Luke Stokes, Jacques
Woodcock, Ben Ramsey) to have some drinks and record "`Voices of the Elephpant`_ -
It's the Booze Talking".  The general discussion resolved around
community (and user groups).  We iterated over quite a few things that Kevin,
Chris and I discussed on the way from Atlanta, but also lots of other things
(it was the booze talking afterall). The total recording time stands at two and
a half hours, so let's see what Cal comes up with editting wise.

Cal left for Code Works 2012 on Monday moring so I was being chaperoned by Luke
to the `Nashville PHP`_ meeting. With free beer and pizza, the place
was rather full, although about the same percentage of RSVPs actually showed up
(~66%) as in Atlanta. And again, we were only four in the pub/bar afterwards to
have a little more banter. This concluded the end of the tour, and I left on
holiday to Seattle on Tuesday morning.

**Some Observations**

All the usergroups used Meet-Up to track attendence, and without failure, only
50-66% of RSVPs showed up at the usergroups. Probably one of the reasons is
that the meetings were on non-standard dates and in some cases in non-standard
locations. I have always found that keeping the same day of the month and
location does wonders for keeping attendence levels. In some cases, attendees
did not show up because Meet-Up showed that the meeting was full (were of
course in fact, there was still about 50% space left). This is a tricky thing.
In some venues you have a hard cap on the amount of people, but if people just
RSVP and then not show up, they clog up places that other people could have
used. At least in one occasion that meant that the attendee simply did not show
up. For `PHP London`_ we also have an RSVP system on Meet-Up with a cap of
(about 130 people). Even though this indicates that the meeting might be full,
the idea is that you can still show up anyway on a first-come, first-served
base. I do not quite like this, as it often shows that the meet-up is full, and
I feel (a bit) unwelcome. I think that user groups should call out to attendees
who RSVP, but then not show up in the cases where this could be a problem.

Another observation that I made is that dynamics of the user groups in the US
are rather different then for example the UK.  In the US, almost everybody
drives to the meetings, and hence there is no possibility of having a social
drink before and after the meeting.  This compared to London, where this is a
huge part. In my opinion, socializing is almost the most important thing of a
usergroup meeting.

**End**

All the slides are on the talks_ page and as soon as I have it, I will make
available the recording from `Atlanta PHP`_ as well. Photos from the trip are
on flickr_.  With this I conclude my wrap-up. I had an amazing time and made
lots of new friends.  I might be tempted to this again.
