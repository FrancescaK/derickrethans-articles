Several months ago I signed a `pledge`_ that I
would publish a blog post today about a woman in technology whom I
admire. Well, when writing this post yesterday, I came to the conclusion
that it's very hard for me to pick just one specific woman to talk
about. So I am talking about more than one, and they're all
rockstars—even the ones that I am not mentioning, you know who you
are.

In the `PHP community`_ there are quite a
few ladies that are actively involved. On the C-side of things (not pun
intended) there's `Sara Golemon`_ and `Elizabeth Smith`_ . Sara works at `Yahoo!`_ doing search engine things, and is the master of writing interesting,
but dangerous extensions to PHP. She's also the author of the only
dedicated book on `PHP's internals`_ . Elizabeth ( `in her own words`_ )
"enjoys doing very perverse things to Windows using PHP" and
is generally known as the person who among other things, fixes things on
Windows, maintains the PHP-GTK bindings. She also occasionally fixes `my code`_ .

With Sara and Elizabeth we also end up at `phpwomen`_ . Together with `Ligaya Turmelle`_ , `Elizabeth Naramore`_ , `Kathy Reid`_ and `Lorna Mitchell`_ they run this
organization to "provide a network of support and mentorship to
women, help women become more involved with PHP, increase our numbers at
conferences as speakers and attendees, and provide a “female
friendly” atmosphere." With their effort, I am sure we'll see
more involvement in the PHP community from the other currently unknown
female PHP types adding to the diversity of our community.
