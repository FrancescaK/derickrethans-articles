When walking back from the restaurant where we've eaten on Friday night
I noticed a conjunction between the Moon and a bright "star".
Checking my maps it turned out to be Jupiter. Both images are taken at
f/2 aperture and a focal length of 55mm. The images of the Moon were
taken with a shutter speed of1/3200s. In the conjunction image I
superimposed an image taken at 1/400s to brighten up Jupiter.
