I had to give a talk at 9.15, the first slot of the day. It went
alright, but I had the feeling that some attendees decided to
sleep in. I went to the "Legal Issues" talk by Rolf Auf Der Maur,
who was talking about legal issues and risk for developing Open
Source; it was kinda interesting, but he made me a bit sad by
saying that "Anti-Patent Activists" have no chance of winning the
war here in Europe. But the discussion that followed concluded
that the "activists" will definitely have an impact on how
Software Patents will be implemented here in Europe.
