Getting to Zurich was not that easy afterall. First we had to wait
3.5 hours at Torp and then we had to stay in a hotel in
Amsterdam. We kinda picket the wrong one. It was very shitty and
not even cheap - 60€ - Hotel Neutraal.

In the hotel in Zurich we discovered that they have different
powersockets here - shrug.
