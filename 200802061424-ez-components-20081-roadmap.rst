After our `release`_ just before Christmas we've been working towards a roadmap for the new
2008.1 release. In the new release we will be addressing some importing
parts of Web applications: RSS/Atom feeds, Document conversion, Search
and Translations. The full `roadmap`_ can be
found on the eZ Components website page.

There are many other things that we're interested at in having as part
of the `eZ Components`_ , but at
the moment don't have the time for to implement. If you are interested
in contributing, have a look at the issues that we've marked `open for contributions`_ in our issue tracker. If you're interested, let
us know through our `mailing list`_ .
