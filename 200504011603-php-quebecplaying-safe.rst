The second session I gave on the PHP Quebec conference was on encrypting and data security. Slides are
again `here`_ . On my last slide I put a puzzle, which would give the first person
that figured it out a copy of my `book`_ . I'll repeat the
puzzle here (and no Jason, you can not compete again ;-)).

Who else figures it out?
