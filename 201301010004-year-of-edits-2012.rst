Just like `last year`_ I've analysed all the edits to OpenStreetMap and
produced a visualisation. It was a bit trickier this year as I also wanted to
visualize the work of the redaction bot as well as the "redaction period" and
the switch to ODbL_ for OpenStreetMap data.

The result is: **OpenStreetMap: A Year of Edits (2012)**:

This animation shows all additions and modifications of nodes (flashes) and
cumulative edits (fading to purple) in 2012. Additional visualisations are the
redaction bot's work (flying away yellow spheres) and the shift to ODbL (green
flash). It gives a good overview of the effort that 1000s of contributors put
in to make OpenStreetMap the best source of mapping data.

You can see the video in HD on Vimeo__.

I have started to make the code for this available through GitHub, but the code_
is very much not modularized and it is likely it will only work on my set-up.
Expect this to change for next year!

**Mappy New Year!**
