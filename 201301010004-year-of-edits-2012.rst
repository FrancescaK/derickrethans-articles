Just like `last year`_ I've analysed all the edits to OpenStreetMap and
produced a visualisation. It was a bit trickier this year as I also wanted to
visualize the work of the redaction bot as well as the "redaction period" and
the switch to ODbL_ for OpenStreetMap data.

The result is: **OpenStreetMap: A Year of Edits (2012)**:

You can see the video in HD on Vimeo__.

I have started to make the code for this available through GitHub, but the code_
is very much not modularized and it is likely it will only work on my set-up.
Expect this to change for next year!

**Happy New Year!**
