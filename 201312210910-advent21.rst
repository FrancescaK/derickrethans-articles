Timezones have always been a pain, and Daylight Saving(s) time does not make
it a lot easier. Then of course you have governments that decide to **change**
the rules. Often that is done nicely in advance, but once in a while the rule
changes are announced at the absolutely `last moment`_, or, sometimes even after the new
rules have come into effect. To track the craziness, have a look at `Time Zone
News`_, and this image to see how many different rules there are!

The changes to rules, and the changes to them are tracked by a group of
volunteers that maintain the `Olson TZ Database`_, named after the now retired
`David Arthur Olson`_. Every so often a new release is made through `IANA's
website`_. The last change happened last Tuesday, and hopefully this is the
last release of this year.

The Olson TZ Database is used_ by a whole lot of software stacks, for example
by almost every Unix system, but there are also implementations for languages.
There is `Yoda time`_ for Java, and PHP's DateTime_ support also uses the
Olson database to be able to calculate the correct local time.

Because the PHP release cycle can not keep up with the releases of the Olson
database, you can update the rule set in PHP by installing newer versions of
the `timezonedb PECL extension`_, which closely follows releases of the 
Olson database.

As I am the maintainer of PHP's DateTime support, I am also responsible for
keeping the database, and it's accompanying PECL extension up-to-date.
With the latest release available through the PECL extension, websites such as
http://time.is can then show you the latest, and correct, local time.
