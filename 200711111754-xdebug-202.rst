I just `released`_ Xdebug
2.0.2. This bugfix release addresses some issues that were introduced
with the improved code coverage performance in Xdebug 2.0.1. There are a
few other issues left, which will be addressed in a future version.

When I `released Xdebug 2.0.0`_ , I asked users (you!) to send me a postcard if you
appreciate my work on Xdebug. So far, I received (only) 26 of them. I
put them online at `flickr`_ .
I am waiting for more ;-) (Address is `here`_ ).
