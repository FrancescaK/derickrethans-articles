Holiday in Norway 2004
======================

.. articleMetaData::
   :Where: Norway

This report describes the adventures from a holiday that I had with a
friend, Ronald, at the end of July in Norway. As I'm currently living
in Norway this seemed the appropriate thing to do. We decided on
making a tour through South and Middle Norway, starting in Skien, the
place where I live, proceed North to Trondheim and go all along the
West Coast through Molde, Bergen and Stavanger to witness the
countless mountains and fjords that make up the country side there.
And the last leg brings us back to Skien through Kristiansand.

Because we knew that we were going in the busy time of the year when
the Norwegians are also celebrating holiday we booked hotels in front
of our trip to have less of a hassle to get a place to sleep. An
excellent help for this is the Lonely Planet guide which offers a lot
of good tips on usually cheaper sleeping and eating facilities. Really
a must to have while traveling virtually everywhere.

*Day 1: Skien to Otta.*

On this first day of our holiday we went from Skien through the
mountains of South and West Norway to Otta, a small town at the
foothills of Rondane National Park. The drive there brought us past
mountains and fjords with some spectacular views which are very hard
to find when following the normal highway routes. Instead of following
those we chose to go for a very different route through some of the
interior of South East Norway. Our hotel, the `Rondeslottet Høyfjellshotell`_
appeared not to be close to the city at all, but halfway upon the
mountain with a view of the peaks of the Rondane National Park, which
was a rather good surprise.

*Day 2: Hiking in Rondane National Park.*

Panorama from the summit of Størronden

In the morning we had some breakfast at the hotel and after wards we
went off to Mysusæter and Rondvassbu to start our hiking trip to the
summit of Størronden. The first leg of the trip was an easy one and a
half hour hike to the camping center building, but after that it
became much harder to keep going. The 'path' to the top was hardly a
path, and mostly we were simply going on top of rocks. After about one
and a half hour climbing we finally made it to a pre-summit and
enjoyed the view for a while. We decided not to go further
to the real summit as the weather was quite bad: lots of wind and the
treat of showers. The way downhill was a bit less tiring, but it
wasn't much faster than going up due to the great amount of loose
stones. After another one and a half hour we made it back to the
camping cabin were we rested for a while before continuing on our last
leg back to the parking place at the border of the National Park where
our car was parked.  After a six hour hike we were finally back and
drove back to the hotel to rest. For dinner we decided to skip the
overly expensive dinner buffet at the hotel and instead we followed a
suggestion from the Lonely Planet to dine at the Pillarguri Kafé in
downtown Otta. The meal was good and after some walking around the
uninteresting town we headed back to the hotel for a good night's
sleep.

*Day 3: Otta to Trondheim.*

Not much interesting today really as we just drove from Otta to
Trondheim using a lot of back roads. Though there were no interesting
things to do, the view were sometimes pretty nice as the roads we took
brought us to some rural areas with very little other tourists around.
We ended up at Stig's place to have a nice barbecue meal because the
weather finally permitted that.

*Day 4: Rafting in Oppdal.*

We drove back to Oppdal to execute Stig's plan to go rafting. After
a short introduction we got our real gear (helmet, wetsuit and
life jacket) and headed by bus to the place were the rafting started.
After another useful half hour theory session on safety and other
important rafting issues we went with our raft into the rived and did
some quick practicing in an eddy while trying to respond to the
commands our (Swedish) raft-guide-to-be Petter was shouting.  Petter
was also having his master-of-the-river examination so we actually had
another guide, Wilhelm, to oversee his handling. We were the first
(out of three) boats to go.

Riding the rapids

The rafting itself was a whole new experience, the butterflies in the stomach
when approaching a rapid and the mandatory splashes of water into our faces. We
did not even get a swimmer (the guide's term for somebody falling out of the
boat), not even in the one rapid deemed "unraftable" by the river book (from
1971). Fortunately the rafts we now use are much better as the ones from 30
years ago of course.  The only person who became swimmer was one of the guides
from another boat. When reaching the end of the trip we learned the seventh
rafting command, called Splash, which the guide used to tell us to try to make
people from other boats as wet as possible.

*Day 5: Sightseeing in Trondheim.*

Although Trondheim does not really feature a lot of sights to spend a
whole week (I tried that two years ago) it definitely has something to
offer. We planned to visit the Nidaros Dom Church, the Tyholt TV Tower
and Munkholmen, but due to some unexpected weather called rain we had
to skip the visit to Munkholen. Unfortunately rain is a major issue
when going on holiday in Norway, especially the West Coast area. The
Tyholt TV tower stands on a hill overlooking Trondheim and is used by
the NRK to broadcast television from. It also features a small
restaurant which serves simple meals and drinks. The Nidaros Church is
in the heart of the city and is about a thousand years old.
Tours are done in a couple of languages but they are
very scattered through the day; that meant that we there are the wrong
time to follow one in English.  Instead we looked around ourselves and
visited the collection of historical gravestones and made a trip up
the very narrow stairs to one of the two towers of the church.

*Day 6: Trondheim to Molde.*

After the few relatively relaxed days in Trondheim we proceeded our
tour to Molde, west of Trondheim. Our route went through the Northern
Fjords area which meant very curvy and narrow mountain roads, some
where less than 3.3 meter wide which makes it quite hard to pass an
oncoming camper. As part of our route we followed the
Atlantershavsvehen, a stretch of asphalt laid over 17 small islands in
the Atlantic ocean interconnected with bridges in various forms and
sizes.

Rica Seilet

In Molde we stayed at the Rica Seilet hotel which is build in the
shape of a large sailing ship. The view from our room on the ninth
floor looked out over the fjord and snowy peaks.  The hotel was quite
up-class but about as expensive as the other hotels we stayed in and it
offered some nice features such as wireless Internet access. The
Lonely Planet guide suggested the Dockside bar as a good place to get
a decent meal, and that's were we went for dinner.

*Day 7: Molde to Sogndal.*

The road from Molde to Sogndal is everything except easy. With so
many fjords and mountains in the way the Norwegians had to come up
with a whole lot of tricks to build roads here. The first hurdle we
encountered where a few ferries which cost around 80 NOK each; the
trip over the fjords are magnificent though.

Trollstigen and the Stigfossen waterfall

After the ferries we
encountered the Trollstigen with 11 hairpins and an average 1:12
gradient. As extra feature a 180 meter high waterfall is next to the
roads. The road is pretty much too small to fit two passing cars, let
alone buses or German campers so it's quite a hassle to get up to
the top.

.. image:: images/content/holiday2004/geiranger.jpg

Geiranger fjorden

Between Eidsdal and Geiranger we crossed another mountain range which
was not really interesting. The interesting part was the last section
of the road, the Ørnevegen which is the name for the decent off the
mountain to Geiranger and gives a great view of the fjord. This is
one of the most often photographed parts of Norway as it is a simply
stunning view.

*Day 8: Sogndal and fjord.*



.. image:: images/content/panorama/thumb/sognefjorden.jpg


Panorama of the Lusterfjorden

We stayed one more day in Sogndal to tour around the Lusterfjorden. We
started by heading to Nigardsbreen, one of the glacier tongues that is part of
Europe's largest ice field: Jostedalsbreen.

.. image:: images/content/holiday2004/nigradsbreen.jpg

The Nigardsbreen glacier

The road goes past a
watercraft energy facility in which you can have a guided tour 10, 12
and 14 o'clock. Hiking on the glacier is also possible, but only with
a guide and it's a very good idea to bring warm clothes as even in
the middle of the summer the temperature on the glacier is very low.

After the visit to the glacier we continued our way to Lom where the
road passes over highlands (up to 1440 meter) with a bizarre landscape
full of ice-cold lakes, snowy summits and bare rocks.

.. image:: images/content/holiday2004/urnes.jpg

The staffkirke at Urnes

We didn't continue all the way to Lom, but instead turned around a
few kilometers before the city as we needed to make it in time to the
staffkirke in Urnes, one of the four sites in Norway that has a place
on UNESCO's World Heritage List. We made it just in time to have a
tour through the Church which closes at 17:30. After visiting the
church there are two ways of getting back to Sogndal, one of them is
driving the 60 km around the fjord again, and the second one is by
small ferry to Stolvern. The ferry is very small, and its last
sailing is at 17:50, which seems coordinated with the closing of the
church at Urnes.

*Day 9: Sogndal to Bergen.*


.. image:: images/content/panorama/thumb/aurlandsfjorden.jpg

Panorama of the Aurlandsfjorden

The E16 between Sogndal and Bergen features two of the longest
tunnels in Norway, the 24.51 km long tunnel from Lærdal to Aurland and
the 11.4 km long Gudvangentunnel. We decided to skip the longest
tunnel because spending 20 minutes under ground did not appeal us;
instead we took the "old" road over the mountain which presented us
with spectacular views of the Aurlandsfjord. Instead of continuing the
E16 after Voss we made another de-tour that brought us past the
Hardanger fjord which also featured another section with countless
hairpin bends on the road.

Buildings near the waterfront in Bergen

Driving in Bergen is a whole adventure too, where a good map really
helps to figure out where you're going. We stayed at the Steens
Hotel where the friendly staff recommended the Bryggeloftet &amp;
Stuene restaurant to us for dinner. This was indeed an excellent
choice and after a good meal we used the Fløibanen to get to a view of
Bergen. Unfortunately when we were about to walk back to the hotel it
started to rain. Apparently it rains about 75% of the time in
Bergen, so it's always wise to bring your umbrella if you're
visiting.

*Day 10: Bergen to Stavanger.*

Weather is a major "problem" for us holidaymakers in Norway. On our
trip from Norway's second largest city down along the *Sundal* to
Stavanger we encountered the form of annoyance in various forms. That
spoiled some of the great views that the route had to offer and made
driving not very easy either. Nevertheless we were able to spot
amazing views of fjords and mountains. The views were already the best
encountered so far, but it could have been even better without the
dreadful rain. The last part of the trip was by ferry to Stavanger
which brought us very close to the "Havly Hotel" in which we were
staying. Dinner we had at an excellent restaurant "Phileas Fogg",
after the persona from Jules Vernes' book, which serves all kinds of
food. The meal was excellent, the prize (around 350 NOK pp) was "good"
for Norway.

*Day 11: Trip to Preikestolen*

.. image:: images/content/holiday2004/preikestolen.jpg

Preikestolen and the Lysefjord

Preikestolen is one of the major tourist attractions around
Stavanger and features a cliff 640 meter high above the Lysefjorden.
The climb up there takes about one hour and fourty five minutes and
is not always easy, but after climbing 370 meter from the starting
point you do get a great view of the fjord below. For the last part of
the climb there are two alternatives: the cliff trail and hill trail.
I would suggest to take the cliff trail on your way to the top, and
the hill trail on your way back as it requires some more climbing.

*Day 12: Stavanger to Kristiansand*

The trip was pretty boring, but the coastal road is kinda nice with
lots of things to do (museums etc), but we were not really interested
in that at all. Kristiansand is a nice city and especially in the
summer when the weather is cooperative an area close to the harbor
with lots of boats/restaurants is really nice. It's there where we
dined at the Bølgen &amp; Moi restaurant and were we had a pleasant
evening laughing at the crazy people with their boats in the harbor.
We stayed at the small Sjøgløtt hotel, which has friendly staff and
decent rooms close to the water front.

*Day 13: Kristiansand to Skien*

We proceeded along the Nordsjø vei, trying to avoid the
highways on our way back to Skien. We did not really see or do
anything useful on this trip and it was quite boring. It was good for
me to be "home" though.

*Day 14: Sightseeing in Skien*

Although Skien is not a very interesting city landmark wise, it has
some funky things if you're bored. This relates mostly to Henrik
Ibsen which was born in Skien and there are some museums about him
around. We did not go there but instead we went to visit Brekkeparken.
Inside the park there is the Telemark museum which has some
replicas and original buildings from a few hundred years ago and some
other smaller exhibitions which rotate during the year.

*Day 15: Oslo*

The last day we visiting Oslo, which is only 2 hours driving away
from Skien; at least, if you're not using the E18 highway. We parked
our car at Oslo Sentral Station and explored the city by public
transport and on foot.

Vikingship in the museum in Oslo

The first site we visited was the Vikingship
museum on the Bøgdoy "museum" peninsula. The museum has 900 year old
remains of three viking ships used for burial, and plenty of materials
found near them on the burial site.

After we got back from the Bøgdoy peninsula by boat-bus we payed a
visit to the fortress that once protected Oslo. There we attended a
guided tour that explained about the history of the fortress and its
inhabitants. This free guided tour is available in the summer months
every two hours (at 10, 12, 14 and 16).

Main statue in Vigiland park

Before ending the day with a simple dinner at the harbor we walked to
the Vigiland park to see some of Vigiland's work. His work consists
of plenty of statues of humans and is mostly located in this Oslo
park. It's definitely worthwhile to visit this major achievement.

*Final words*

With the trip to Oslo the holiday was at its end. As you can see
Norway has plenty to offer, from exciting activities such as rafting
to fabulous places to go hiking, and from magnificent views of fjords
to viking-age buildings and remains. We had a lot of fun here, but
next year I still want something else. I guess it's finally time to
go to Oz.
