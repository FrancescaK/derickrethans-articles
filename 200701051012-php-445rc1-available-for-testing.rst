The first release candidate of PHP 4.4.5 is now available for download:

`http://downloads.php.net/derick/php-4.4.5RC1.tar.bz2`_ (ee9238175c6b6ecec8712954065451c4)

`http://downloads.php.net/derick/php-4.4.5RC1.tar.gz`_ (5337c72e3d70fb88b932215957e250f8)

As PHP 4.4 is just in maintenance mode, there are no new features. This
release however does address over 20 bugs. We do not anticipate any
regressions to be introduced by this RC, but I would still like to ask
everyone to take a few minutes and test it against their code base. If
you come across any issues report them via `http://bugs.php.net/`_ .
