Xdebug is finally nearing version 2 and the only really important thing
missing is a good and simple client that can speak the `DBGp`_ to interact with `Xdebug`_ . As I have no clue myself about
GUI programming, I am hereby asking for your help to write a simple GUI
application (QT/KDE/GTK/Gnome) that can do this.

This GUI application should be as standalone as possible, run on Linux
and implement the full DBGp specification, including setting
breakpoints, seeing stack traces, inspecting variables and stepping
through code. Editting scripts in the interface should not even be
possible.

If you are interested, feel free to write me at either derick@xdebug.org
or preferrably through the xdebug-general@lists.xdebug.org mailinglist.
I can provide all the help that you need with the protocol.
