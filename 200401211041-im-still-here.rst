It has been a while since the last blurp, have been busy getting to know my
collegues at `eZ Systems`_ the last two weeks in Norway.

I'm currently not home either, but attending the `Vancouver PHP Conference`_ where I'll be speaking on the Mcrypt extension, and on "How to
write an extension". The trip here was a bit eventfull, as on
Heathrow they had to clear about the whole terminal because of a
firealarm. Anyway, with one and a half hour delay we left and made
it in Vancouver about 20 mins late. It was a looong flight though.
