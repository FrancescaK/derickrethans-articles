It looks like the `French`_ voted
against the European Constitution. The Dutch will probably do the same
on Wednesday. I already cast my vote for it, also a No. I don't want a
constitution that still leaves the European Parliament without powers,
so that things like the `Software Patents`_ are not pushed through by the European Commision. (And no,
this is not the only reason why I'm against).
