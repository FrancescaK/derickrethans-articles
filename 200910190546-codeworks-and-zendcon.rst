`CodeWorks`_ was a blast, I
recorded a few talks that I will be publishing through `Vimeo`_. As teaser I have a recording of
Scott MacVicar's `PECL picks`_ talk. I also have recordings of Brian Moon's Memcached talk, Chris
Shiflett's Security-Centered Design talk and Sharon Levy's Web-Based
Retrieval Demystified talk. With all the other random video material I
am creating a compilation as well, but that will have to wait a bit
more.

At the moment I am on my way to San Jose where I will speak on `Xdebug`_ and PHP's `DateTime support`_. Xdebug 2.1 is now
feature complete, and I will be working on getting all the open bugs
resolved. A release before the end of the year seems likely.
