We're having a Mexican party tonight.. so it seems like a good plan to make some Margarita's for that. Here
follows a (famous) recipe:

`Ingredients:`_

::

	1 &amp; 2/3 cups of Cuervo Especial gold tequila (or any good tequila you want)
	1/4 cup Grand Marnier
	1/2 cup fresh lime juice, about 2 to 2 &amp; 1/2 large limes
	1 tablespoon of grated lime zest
	3 tablespoons sugar

Steeping the margarita mixture: Mix the sugar with 1 cup of warm water until sugar dissolves. Then mix it
with the tequila, Grand Marnier, lime juice and `lime zest`_ in a glass or plastic pitcher or bottle. `Cover and refrigerate`_ at least 2 hours (but
no more than 24 hours). Strain and drink.

If you want, you can rub the rims of your glasses with lime wedges then dip them into coarse salt. Serve
them either straight up or on the rocks.
