Matthew set up a company event for Maguma and Web.by to go
Törggelen at a farm close to his house, Kroftsteiner Hof .
Törggelen is a local customn in which you visit with a group a
farm, eat freash harvested food from their land, and ofcourse drink
from their land. Valtourns is a good hour driving from Merano and
after stopping by the office to fetch the directions we headed off to
Valtourno. We drove through a lot of small little towns, as we didn't
want to bother with the highway and pay toll.

We arrived at the Törggelen quite early, so we strolled a bit
around the yard and saw some amazing views. After about half an hour
the other people arrived and we went down into a room where the feast
was about to start. Wine and apple juice were available in unendless
supplies and were used to a great extend by certain people. The meal
started with slices of cheese and speck, bread and butter and
potatoes.

The second course consisted of Sauerkraut, Schwein and Würstl; all
very un-italian food, but definitely Süd-Tirolian food. Although

I'm not too fond of Sauerkraut, the combination with the meat made
things much better for me. After the main meal chestnuts and walnuts
followed. The chestnuts were all roasted and warm, which gives a nice
extra swing to the taste. Sterling took on a bet to eat 7 chestnuts
with in a minute, if he succeeded he could borrow Gunnar's BMW for a
day. He already knew were to drive to. Of course he didn't succeed in
eating them in a minute, but atleast he didn't spit them out :).

After the nuts "Grappa" was brought to us. It comes in two flavors,
one with poppy seed, and one with spinach. The seed and spinach are
enclosed into a dough like banana. (The picture shows better what it

is than I can described.) The Grappa was followed by some great fresh
harvested apples. After those four courses the meal was finally over,
except for the local liqueur Grappa, which is usually a liqueur made out
of grapes, but there is also a walnut version of it. It's a strong
liqueur, and people seemed to like it a lot... drinking shots with one
of the employees into the late Saturday night hours.
