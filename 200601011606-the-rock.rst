At the center of `this image`_ you can see a faint rock - the largest one in our solar
system. It is larger than every known asteroid, moon, and comet
nucleus. It is larger than any other local rocky planet. This rock is
so large its gravity makes it nearly spherical, and holds heavy gases
near its surface. Today, this rock starts another orbit around its
parent star, for roughly the 5 billionth time, spinning over 350 times
during each trip. Happy New Year to all the human inhabitants of this
rock we call Earth.

(Didn't think of this text myself though, "borrowed" it from `here`_ .)
