That's right - I will not need a map for my next trip. Tomorrow I'll go
back to the Netherlands, and this time by car. It's a long 11 hour-or-so
drive, but they're all familiar roads. In the next month I have a busy
schedule.

Next week I'll be speaking at the `Intl. PHP Conference in Amsterdam`_ on "Dominating the World" (Internationalization),
"Defending Against Users" (SAPI Input-filter) and
"Playing Safe" (Encryption).

Then I will visit my parents for a few days until I head off to Mexico
for `php|tropics`_ where I
will speak on "Clustering `PHP`_ and `MySQL`_ ", "Practical
Debugging Techniques" (with `Xdebug`_ )
and "Playing Safe" (Encryption).

The weekend after I return from Mexico I will drive back to Norway again
for `eZ's`_  `Summer Camp`_ in the first week of
June, where I will have a talk on "Optimizing `eZ publish`_ and Enterprise
Hosting".
