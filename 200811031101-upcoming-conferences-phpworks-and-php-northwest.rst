In the
upcoming two weeks I'll be embarking on a little trip, where I'll be
speaking at `php|works`_ in
Atlanta on Test Driven Development and on Date and Time handling with
PHP. The latter subject is also the topic of a new book that I've been
working on in the past months. Before going home and after visiting
Redmond I'll head to Manchester to give a keynote titled
"K.I.S.S." at the `PHP Northwest`_ conference. Looking forwards to see all my PHP friends again!
