`php|architect`_ published an article in the `January`_ issue about the `Transliteration Extension`_ . In this article I explain all the different filters
and where transliteration of scripts is useful - as an example is generation of "nice urls" from a CMS
given. The same issue also has an article about "Generating OpenOffice.org documents" written by my `collegue Bård`_ .
