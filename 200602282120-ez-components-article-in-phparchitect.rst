In `this month's`_ issue of php|architect you can find an article on the `eZ components`_ . In
this article I explain the goals for the project as well as
architectural decisions that we took while developing this components
library. It also shows a small example on how to use the components.
Unfortunately the service (http://geo.derickrethans.nl.) it talks about
is not yet life... I should get that going soon.
