Logging

   :Where: Arnhem, The Netherlands

You see it more and more often, people writing their stuff thoughts
down and putting them on the Internet. You might wonder who is interested in
this crap they spit out; but it is clearly that people actually read those
weblogs.

For example a fellow weblogger (from which I stole most of the
design of this site), `Marko Karppinen`_
was asked by a contact at Apple how camp X-ray was going. (To find out what the
heck camp X-ray is, see Marko's blog).

But what do people actually want with those weblogs of them? Do they want to
show how bored they are at work? Are they some kind of exhibitionists? This
are questions which mostly will never be answered. For most people weblogging
is simply a way to write down their frustrations and annoy other human persons
with it, this is clearly the case for me. For me weblogging is a way to write
down what is on my mind at this very moment.
