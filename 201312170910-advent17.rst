Anybody who is vaguely familiar with Xdebug_ probably has seen its glorious
orange stack traces gracing their screens. In case you have not, they look
like:

In this case, the ``tell_a_lie_and_hurt_you()`` function tried to call
`strlen()`_ with incorrect arguments.

Xdebug overloads PHP's internal error handler to do this, but it is also
possible to trigger stack traces yourself. You can of course use
`trigger_error()`_, but Xdebug also provides the
`xdebug_print_function_stack()`_ function. Running
``xdebug_print_function_stack()`` instead of the erroneous ``strlen()``
results in:

As the documentation state, you can also provide your own message::

    <?php

    function tell_a_lie_and_hurt_you()
    {
        xdebug_print_function_stack("You have been rickrolled!");
    }

Which then results in:

This was all good, and then my friend Rob_ asked: 

    hypothetically, how hard would it be to change
    xdebug_print_function_stack() so that it didn't output the filename and
    line number in the orange box?

Well, it didn't turn out to be `very hard`_. Rob requested_ this feature
because he was writing his own error handler. And with your own error handler
it does not make a whole lot of sense to show where
``xdebug_print_function_stack()`` was called from. After my commit, you can
now supply a second argument to ``xdebug_print_function_stack()``::

    <?php

    function tell_a_lie_and_hurt_you()
    {
        xdebug_print_function_stack("You have been rickrolled!", XDEBUG_STACK_NO_DESC);
    }

Which then results in a stack trace without header:

This new feature will be part of Xdebug 2.3.
