We've created a roadmap for the upcoming `eZ Components`_ (2008.2) release. In
this release our main focus is to add MVC support. Where most frameworks
dedicate a specific router, controller and view, the MVC implementation
in eZ Components will only consist of very loosely based parts. For each
of the specific parts of MVC we will provide one or more default
implementations, as well as detailed information on how to write your
own implementations of a Model, View and Controller. Of course most of
those implementations will be done through Tie-in components. At the
moment we're creating a requirements and design specification. If you're
interested in participating in this discussion, please drop by on our `mailinglist`_ .

Besides this main focus, we will also enhance some of the critical
components that the upcoming version of eZ Publish will require. Please
see the `full roadmap`_ .
