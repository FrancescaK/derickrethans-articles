If you're writing a large library of code which you want to see other
people used too, picking a license is a very important thing. We were
standing for the same choice for our `eZ components`_ . Originally we were using the LGPL as this is more in
line with the GPL that we currently use for `eZ publish`_ . Now just
before the release of the first public beta (in a few days, stay tuned)
we decided to switch to the `New BSD`_ license. We feel that choosing the New BSD license would make it easier
for people to use the components library without having to worry about
the restrictions of the LGPL.
