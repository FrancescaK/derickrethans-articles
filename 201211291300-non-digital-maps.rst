As you probably know, I am pretty much into OpenStreetMap_ and digital maps.
I have always found (paper) maps, and different visualisations fascinating.  I
found myself at London GeoMob_ last Thursday where I encountered two types of
non-digital, non-paper maps.

The first one, was a 1800s style rendering of London from `Wellingtons
Travel`_ — fully hand-drawn. I found them quite beautiful, and would be happy
to have one on my wall. Some pictures that I took of it are here:

I am even more excited about a second project: SplashMaps_. At some point you
probably have been in a situation where you were out and about walking
somewhere in a city or the country and you had to find your way. In cities you
can often ask people and/or get our your phone, but that doesn't cut it when
you are on some remote hill in Scotland. You need a paper map (for more than
one reason!). And of course, it is always raining (we're in Scotland after
all!). Ordnance Survey will sell you laminated `Explorer Maps`_ for this,
which have saved me quite a few times. However, they are bulky and the place
that you are looking for is either always on a fold, or on the opposite site
of the map!

At GeoMob_ a solution showed up in the form of SplashMaps—they are basically a
map printed on cloth, water-proof, but you can still use a marker to mark out
your route, wash it, and it is good as new again.  Here is a picture of one of
their prototypes of the New Forest:

The maps are
specifically made with walking and cycling (in national parks) in mind, so it
has all the features that are important: paths, bike repair shops, bogs and
pubs (and a lot more!). They are currently running a funding round on
KickStarter_ and I would urge you to check them out. I have backed the project
and looking forwards to getting my maps for my favourite parks... I do need to
think about which ones they are!
