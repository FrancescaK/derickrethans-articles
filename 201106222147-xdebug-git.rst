I've just opened my Xdebug_ repository_ on github_. Importing my old
SVN repository was a bit of a task. With the help of Ole Marius Smestad
I managed to cook up a bash script to import and fix-up the repository.
In the meanwhile I've learned more about git than I ever wanted to know,
but still not enough. I maintain that, although git is very powerful,
it is also a lot less intuitive than SVN (or even CVS).

In any case, Xdebug is now on github, as well as the Xdebug website_
(http://xdebug.org), my proof-of-concept debugging client GtkDBGp_ and
the specification of the protocol that Xdebug uses: DBGp_. The issue tracker is
still at the old location—http://bugs.xdebug.org—and I am not intending to
change that.  I will keep the SVN repository active for now.
