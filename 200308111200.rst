Canada Holiday

   :Where: British Columbia, Canada

This is the journal of my holiday trip to western Canada which I did
together with a friend Ronald, between July 23, 2003 and August 7,
2003. I hope you enjoy the journal as much as we enjoyed our holidays
:)

*Day #1*: The holiday started in the wrong way when the people at
check-in told us that the flight would have a two hour delay in
Amsterdam due to technical problems. Because of this we would also
miss our connection in Chicago to Calgary and thus we had to wait five
hours there before the next flight was scheduled. When we finally
arrived at Chicago it was a bit of a mess as my friend Ronald was put
through some 'additional' security checks. But we managed to find each
other again, and we also called `Zak`_ to say we would be a
little (5 hours!) late. Atleast Zak and his wife Mandy
picked us up from the airport after a boring and long day. Opening my
suitcase I found a leaflet from the DOT which you can find on the
right.

*Day #2*: This day started much better by sleeping a tad
bit long, but that was only because of the little jetlag, and just the
sheer tiredness from the day before. After breakfest we grabbed a bus
and halted at a park on an island in the Elbow. 

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/aaf.thumb.jpg

We did a little walking here amongst some of the quiested places in Calgary.
Time for some coffee from `The Planet`_ (Well, no coffee for me, as I only
drink tea, but you get the idea). It's a nice little place where a lot of
different people meet and it's the ideal way to start your day. But of course,
we couldn't stay there for ever and we thus ended up at the `Glenbow museum`_
where Inuit art was running as a temporary exhibition. Besides the temporary
exhibition there are also some 'default' exhibutions which show for example the
little statue on the left. For dinner we went to `Mortal Coil`_, a nice place
to lounge, eat, and drink some great Martinis.

*Day #3*: After picking up our rental car at `Rent-a-Wreck`_, which may sound
weird for a rental car agency, in Calgary we set off for Dinasour Valley, which
is situated some 150 km east of Calgary.  After a boring drive on very strait
roads we finally arrived in `Drumheller`_, Alberta where the Badlands are
situated.  

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/aao.thumb.jpg

Due to erosion the valleys, which are very rich of dinasour and related
fossils, are strangely formed. The erosion also made it easy to obtain
prehistoric material. The `Royal Tyrrell Museum`_ has a large exhibition of
those fossils. One of their nicest found objects is the fosil of the T-rex
which you can see on the right here. After visiting the museum we went for a
walk in the nearby area to enjoy some of the strange soil formations. When back
in Calgary Zak took us to a very interesting Ethopian restaurant. The food is
full of flavors and comes without utensils on a plate :).

*Day #4*: Today we started our 2,000 km tour to Prince Rupert.  In the first
part we went from Calgary to Jasper in the Rocky Mountains. It lead through two
national parks, `Banff National Park`_ and `Jasper National Park`_. Just before
Banff we had our first encounter with the Rocky Mountains, which seemed massive
to us. 

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/abc.thumb.jpg

Instead of following
highway 1 to Lake Louise we took our first detour through the Bow
Valley Parkway which showed us some breathtaking scenery (such as the
one on the left). 

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/abr.thumb.jpg

Past Lake Louise we continued through Banff
NP over the Icefields Parkway to Jasper and made our first major stop
at the Columbia Icefield, which is the largest glacier south of
Alaska.  We opted for taking a little hike on the Athabasca Glacier
(right) which was quite a cold experience. Not really because the
temperature was that low at all, but mostly because of the strong
winds blowing over the ice. 

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/abw.thumb.jpg

After our one hour hike we left
and headed to our next stop, the Athabasca Falls (For some reason the
Canadians have little creativity for chosing names for landmarks :) a bit
further to the north.  The Athabasca River gets it water from the
melting water of the Columbia Icefield and thunders here through a
narrow gorge where the walls have been smoothed and potholes are
created by the sheer force of the rushing water carrying sand and
rock. Just after the falls we went further north on another
'alternative' route.  

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/acc.thumb.jpg

This road was really bad, even
worse than the roads in Montreal.  After a couple of kilometers the RV in
front of us suddenly stopped and one of the persons got out with a
camera. We of course watched what the guy was doing and found out that
he spotted a bear.  Woot! Our first bear encounter, on the first day
of our trip.  Unfortunately he was quite concealed in the bushes but I
still made quite a nice photo of it (right). 

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/acf.thumb.jpg

In Jasper we found
the `Astoria Hotel`_ to spend the night. The
hotel was quite a disappointment because of the small rooms, and the
definitely annoying warm rooms without A/C. Because the room sucked we
made an attempt at walking to one of the nearby lakes, but because we
didn't get to it within 25 minutes we instead walked back and got our
car, us lazy bastards. The drive was quite worthwhile, as you can see
that Lake Patricia is pretty beautiful (left).

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/acr.thumb.jpg

*Day #5*: We started by going back on our route from yesterday
to take the `Jasper Tramway`_ up mount
Whistler. After a 15 minute ride with the gondola we arrived at the
summit station at 7800 feet. We heard that if we would walk to the top
we would have a very nice 360 degrees view, so off we went. 

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/aco.thumb.jpg

They
forgot to tell that it would take 1.5 kilometer to get there though.
After the first summit came the second, and after the second the third
and last one. But indeed, there was definitely a terrific view
from the 'real' summit. Exhausted from the hike we just set there for
a couple of minutes, and made some photos of the view such as the one
on the right of Lake Patricia and Lake Pyramid. Back in the
valley we continued en route to Vanderhoof, a little town 100km west
of Prince George. The trip was pretty uneventful, except of course
from the beautiful scenery and our second bear encounter.

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/acw.thumb.jpg
 

This time the little bugger was feeding itself on berries at the side
of the road. Without bushes hindering vision, I quickly snapped some
pictures of which the one here is the best one.

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/ada.thumb.jpg

In Vanderhoof we found our hotel, `North Country Inn`_, without much hassle.
The tip from the `Lonely Planet`_ showed up like a really good one. The Inn had
large rooms, an excellent restaurant and was very decently priced. After dinner
we were pretty much too tired to do anything useful, so I went to enjoy a nice
warm bath to relax.


.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/adh.thumb.jpg

*Day #6*: After Vanderhoof we made a small tour to `Fort St.  James`_, a
historic site about 70km north of Vanderhoof. It's a old fur trading outpost,
restored to it's state of 1896. 

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/adq.thumb.jpg

It's a quite
interesting place to see as there are some 'inhabitants' who explain
about the live in the late 19th century at the outpost. After
our visit we then headed for Smithers, halfway between Vanderhoof and
our first way point, Prince George. Not much interesting to tell about
the rest of our trip there, but of course the scenery was again
beautiful. The hotel in Smithers was again found easily and had a nice
large room. I was not particulairly happy with the dinner they served
in their restaurant Pepper Jack, but it was not that bad either.


.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/adr.thumb.jpg

*Day #7*: From Smithers we continued to Prince Rupert on the
coast. A few kilometers out of Smithers we encountered a little
village, Mauricetown, where a bunch of people was fishing for salmon
in the river. 

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/aeb.thumb.jpg

A ranger visiting the place explained that they catch
the fish by sticking a rod with a few hooks on it into the water and
'feel' if there is a fish. If they find one, they (of course) try to
get it onto the shore. It was strictly prohibited to sell the fish he
said, and people would be severly fined if they were caught.

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/adx.thumb.jpg

In the
afternoon we crashed at a little creek called 'Kweana' which means
gold. The water was ice-cold but I still got in to cool down a bit, it

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/ael.thumb.jpg

was a not-too-pleasent experience though, as the water was really
really cold there. We also passed some other mountain range which
looks like 'ten peaks', although I'm not sure if this is really that
famous place. When we almost got to Prince Rupert we saw some
interesting things happen, like rising coulds from a mountain. Okay
okay, it's not that interesting, but it still made a very nice
photo.

*Day #8*: The Inside Passage mini-cruise is supposed to be one
of the most breathtaking boat tours in the world. But in order to get
on the ship, we needed to rise quite early, 5:30am as we needed to
board the Queen of the North at 6:30am. After getting on board we
enjoyed our breakfest, which was included on the trip (after buying a
ticket for it of course). 

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/aer.thumb.jpg

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/aex.thumb.jpg

As soon as the sun burned
through the clouds we went on-deck to enjoy the sun. There were some
whales in the neighbourhood, but they were hard to see due to the
distance and their stealthyness. Actually, you could only see a tail
once in a while. In the afternoon it got very windy outside, so we
were forced to go inside and entertain ourselves. At least the ship
had a small 'cinema' where we saw `Basic`_ after dinner. At
11:15pm we finally arrived at our destination, Port Hardy on Vancouver
Island. We had some trouble finding our Bed and Breakfest there, but
once that was sorted out we jumped straight into bed.


.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/afb.thumb.jpg

*Day #9*: A real race against the clock would start
today. We booked the ferry in Nanaimo at three o'clock so that I could
be in time for my presentation at the `Vancouver PHP Group`_. We started in
a wrong way by getting up not too early and enjoying the very
extensive breakfest at our `B&amp;B`_. After
breakfest we almost raced to Nanaimo but also took some time to enjoy
the scenery of course. Wee ended up nice in time for the ferry,
which would be leaving at 15:00. Then distaster came upon us. Just
before we would board the ferry, our rental car refused to start. We
called with the rentel company and decided to leave the car in Nanaimo
so that we could take the ferry as foot passenger and get a
replacement car in Vancouver. The fine folks at BC Ferries helped us
getting things done on their end, such as moving the car to a parking
lot, and arranging new tickets for us. Of course, we were not able to
catch the 15:00 ferry anymore, and had to wait two more hours. 

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/afe.thumb.jpg

In Vancouver Beth picked us up from the ferry and drove us to Active
State's office in Vancouver were I could finally start with the
presentation on `Xdebug`_. In order to demo
Xdebug I did need to login to my laptop at home, as PHP changed during
the last few days and it would crash the installation all the time.
Due to my paranoid security I had to ssh to our office firewall, from
there to a server at the office, and from there through VPN ssh to my
laptop at home... the lag was not too bad fortunately. After the
presentation we went with some of the attendees went for some food and
a drink to `Steamworks`_.

.. image:: images/content/lamps.jpg

*Day #10*: With a slow start we begun our day. Shane and Beth, our hosts
had to go to work so we were kicked out of the house to do something
of our own. We decided to start walking to Granville Island, which
harbours a lot of art shops and the like. 

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/afh.thumb.jpg

After a stroll we then went along to the `Space Center and Planetarium`_ where
we spend most of the afternoon. The planetarium was showing a show called `'The
Lamps Of Atlantis'`_.  After the planetarium show we headed back to the
`ActiveState`_ office to pick up Shane. There it was decided to head for a new
Indian Restaurant in town, `Vij's`_ which serves *excellent* Indian food,
though the waiting time to get seated isquite long (but that's due to the
popularity of the restaurant). So together with a bunch of ActiveState people
we enjoyed our dinner much.

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/afv.thumb.jpg

*Day #11*: Today we picked up our new rental car at Rent-a-wreck in
Vancouver, dropped it off at Shane's place and then headed for the `Vancouver Aquarium`_ in `Stanley Park`_.

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/afj.thumb.jpg

The aquarium is not only an aquarium though, there are also a few
other sections, such as a tropical forest (including crocs and
butterflies). One of the major events there is the whale show, where
Beluga Whales do little tricks in orer to get more fish ;).

.. image:: images/content/celebration-of-light.png

The aquarium is a nice place to visit, and outside the site itself, they
also provide advise to and support other environment related projects
in BC. After our visit to the aquarium we drove a bit through Stanley
Park, and after that around the area and of course past China Town.
While that is not the most interesting place in Vancouver, it's
certainly worth a small look. In the evening Beth made her famous
killer Margeritas for the party later that night, which would be after
the `Celebration of Light`_
fireworks event. After our first sampling of the drink Shane went off
to order Mexican food to go with the Margeritas. But he ordered a
little bit too much of it, thus his statement 'Never order food when
you had a Margerita'. Just before 10 people came dripping in and we
went to put on the chairs on the roof of the building (which is ten
stories hight) to have a good view of the fireworks. It was a truly
beautiful `show`_. After the fireworks we
continued drinking and talking until about 3am after we went to sleep.
Needless to say that most people attending the party were quite drunk
;).

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/afw.thumb.jpg

*Day #12*: Waking up late with the after effects of last night's
party we departed for Kamloops. We didn't take highway 1 East straight
from Vancouver, but instead we went north through Whistler, a popular
ski-resort. The road there was turning a lot, and quite packed with
traffic so it took us quite a long time to get to Whistler. Continuing
over 99 north we discovered that the road lead through the mountains.

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/aga.thumb.jpg

Driving there was great fun, because of the winding roads, the very
low traffic and a speed limit of 80km/h, which you could almost never
reach anyway.  Past Cache Creek we then proceeded to Kamloops on
highway 1 and we noticed a lot of smoke in both valleys and on distant
hills. We were heading straight to the bush fires. Another remarkable
thing is that as soon we came out of the mountains the whole area was
very dry and very unlike the rest of BC. It looked more like a desert
than the green slopes we were used to see.

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/agc.thumb.jpg

In Kamloops we could see smoke on the hill across the valley, which made the
news on the bush fires look really real to us. Arriving at our hotel, the `Sage
Brush motel`_ we quickly went to dinner after a nice talk with the friendly
staff.

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/age.thumb.jpg

*Day #13*: Because of the bushfires we first checked if
we could use Highway 1 to Calgary. We knew that some roads were closed
and fortunately none of them would directly affect them. The first few
hours there was a lot of smoke in the valleys and the air smelled
awful. About 25 km before Golden we encountered a traffic jam... which
would totally destroy our day. After about two hours we ended up in
Golden and decided to take a detour by taking 95 South in Golden, and
then 93 North to back to Highway 1 so that we didn't have to stay in
the jam any longer. Traffic on 95 South was light and we were making
good progress. After about 40 km we stopped to relax a bit and there
we spoke with some other folks which explained to us that the 93 was
closed near Highway 1 because of the bush fires. This meant that we
needed to head back for Golden and go all the way through the traffic
jam. 

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/agf.thumb.jpg

That sucked badly. After about an hour we were finally in Golden
again and then we still head to go atleast another 15 km inside the
queue. Sigh. When we finally made it to the endpoint, we noticed that
there was a contruction site with no signals at all. The jam was
caused to the vast amount of traffic on that day (due to BC day) and the
closed roads because of the bush fires. After we passed the
construction site we could finally continue our journey  normally. 

.. image:: http://photos.derickrethans.nl/album/canada2003/agg.thumb.jpg

By
that time we spend about 4.5 hour in the damned traffic jam. We
stopped two times more, the first stop was Edward's pass (left) the
second stop was at the spiral tunnels. As you can see on the picture
on the right it was getting pretty dark already. Just after crossing
the Alberta border we ended up in a pretty nasty thunderstorm and
rain. But just before we passed the Calgary city borders it stopped
raining and finally we arrive at Zak's place again around 1am.
Exhausted as we were, we headed to bed right away.

*Day #14*: On the last day of our holidays we relaxed a bit and
went shopping with Mandy. In the evening we went to a `Japanese restaurant`_
were Mandy's friend Jane was celebrating her birthday. Returning from
the restaurant we decided to go to the cinema, there we chose the
movie `The Italian Job`_ which was quite entertaining.

*Day #15*: The flight home had no problems at all, except that
it was boring (just like any other overnight cross-Atlantic flight).
For once the trains in the Netherlands were playing nice and I ended
up being hom around 13:00 (on Day 16 actually).
