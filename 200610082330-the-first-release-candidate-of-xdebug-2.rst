In the past few months I've been working on various fixes (and feature
additions) for Xdebug. Most notable are the much improved code coverage
and the new `stack trace layout`_ . All `these changes`_ made it into Xdebug 2.0.0RC1 which I just released through
PECL. The source code is also avaible through the `Xdebug`_ website. Left before the final
release are some build fixes for the debugclient and hopefully I can
also bundle a `real debugging client`_ .
