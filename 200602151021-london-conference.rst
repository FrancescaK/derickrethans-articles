Last Friday I spoke at the `PHP UK Conference`_ in London on the `eZ components`_ .
(Presentation slides as as usual on the `talks`_ page). I enjoyed this conference, which
was organized by the `PHP London User Group`_ . This was their first conference, and the organizers
did an excellent job. I always enjoy going to a conference for users
(as opposed to business conferences) so much more.

Harry Fuecks had an interesting session on `Ajax and Latency`_ where he describes that Ajax frameworks need to come
a long way before they are really usable. I can not agree more with the
points that he made.

In case you are interested in hearing about the eZ components and you
missed my talk in London, I will be giving a similar presentation
through `php|architect`_ by means of
a webcast next Friday. This is a free webcast for which you can sign up `here`_ .

Of course a trip by me never goes without taking pictures, you can find
them in my `gallery`_ .
