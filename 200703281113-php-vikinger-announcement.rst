The PHP Vikinger is a community-driven PHP event that will be held in
Skien, Norway on June 9th. Like the famous Foo Camp and Bar Camp, PHP
Vikinger is driven by its attendees. The people who come choose and
present the sessions at the event.

Attendance is by a mix of invitation and registration. A bunch of
invitations have been sent to various PEAR and PHP contributors and last
year's attendees; and there are of course spots open for people who
register normally. Additionally, the invitees have been asked to invite
other people who they think would be cool to have at this event. There
is about a hundred open spots in total.

The event is meant to be as affordable as possible; registration is
free, and simple food (lunch) will be provided. The major expense for
most attendees will be the cost of travelling to Norway.
