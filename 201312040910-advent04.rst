A while ago I started reading `Expert C Programming`_, a book on the
intricacies of C, written almost 20 years ago (in 1994). I can very greatly
recommend this book, even for seasoned C developers. Even although I know
about most of the subjects addressed in the book, I picked up a few new things
as well.

Anyway, the book made me look at my default compiler flags again. I tended not
to use ``-Wall`` at all, but I've since then expanded my ``CFLAGS`` to ``-Wall
-Wextra -Wdeclaration-after-statement -Wmissing-field-initializers
-Wshadow -Wno-unused-parameter``. When running with the new flags, the `MongoDB
driver for PHP`_ started throwing (among others) the following warning during
compilation::

    /home/derick/dev/php/derickr-mongo-php-driver/bson.c:1069:12: warning: declaration of ‘buffer’ shadows a global declaration [-Wshadow]
      char *buffer;
            ^

At first I found this odd, as I could not find the declaration at all, until I
looked closer at the location where the compiler though I had the error::

    In file included from /home/derick/dev/php/derickr-mongo-php-driver/bson.c:26:0:
    /home/derick/dev/php/derickr-mongo-php-driver/php_mongo.h:301:3: warning: shadowed declaration is here [-Wshadow]
    } buffer;
      ^

And this pointed me to the ``buffer struct``::

    typedef struct {
        char *start;
        char *pos;
        char *end;
    } buffer;

This ``typedef`` declares ``buffer`` into the global scope and therefore the
compiler rightfully warns us about this when trying to compile ``char
*buffer;`` in a function. The fix_ was to add the prefix ``mongo_`` so that
the new name becomes ``mongo_buffer``. The ``mongo_`` prefix is what we use
for all the other structs we define as well.
