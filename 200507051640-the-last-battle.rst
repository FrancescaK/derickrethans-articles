Tomorrow the European Parliament is voting for or against software
patents. This is a very important issue for all people in Europe dealing
with software development - both commerical vendors as Open Source
software developers.

Many companies, including `eZ systems`_ have `seen the light`_ that software patents in its current proposal are going
to be a total disaster. A small example that shows why software patents
are bad can be found `here`_ -
from this example you learn that virtually any web application has
patented parts in it. Visit the `No Software Patents!`_ web site to see what *you* can do - before it's
too late! Before the large corporations like Philips, Siemens and Nokia
have `the power to kill any innovation in software`_ in Europe. This is
something we don't want here!
