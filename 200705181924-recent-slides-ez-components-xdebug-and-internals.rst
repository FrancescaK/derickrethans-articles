I took some time to create some PDFs of the slides that I used during
recent presentations. There is the `eZ Components`_ presentation that I
have given at `PHP Norge`_ and the PHP
Internals and `Xdebug`_ presentations
that I have given at `php|tek`_ . You can
find all the PDFs at the `talks`_ page.
