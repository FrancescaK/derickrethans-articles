Just like the `last few years`_ I've analysed all the edits to OpenStreetMap and
produced a visualisation. This year I wanted to highlight different projects
that OpenStreetMap contributors have done and so instead of having an uniform
rotational spinning globe it moved between interesting events.

The result is: **OpenStreetMap: A Year of Edits (2013)**:

   :Title: OpenStreetMap: A Year of Edits (2013)

This animation shows all additions and modifications of nodes (flashes) and
cumulative edits (fading to purple) in 2013. 

Some of the highlighted events in no particular order are:

 - `Antarctica coastline imports`__
 - `Completion of the boundary data in France`__ (In French)
 - `Relief mapping in the Philippines`__

You can see the video in HD on Vimeo__.

I have started to make the code for this available through GitHub, but the code_
is very much not modularized and it is likely it will only work on my set-up.
Perhaps I manage to fix this better during the upcoming year!

**Mappy New Year!**
