From April 26th to 28th I will presenting at `php|tek`_ in Orlando. On this
third "cruise" I will hold three sessions. In the first talk
I will be talking about rapid application developing, using examples
from the `eZ components`_ . On the second day I'm trying something new:
"Derick's Ranting Hour". During this hour I will be listening
to the ranting of users about all things they don't like in PHP. If
there are not enough people complaining than I will give a shot at it
myself :). On the third and last day I will be talking about PHP's
improved date and time handling.

As this time the "cruise" is not in the Bahamas or in Canc√∫n,
you should have less problems convincing your boss to send you to this
conference. Hope to see you there!
