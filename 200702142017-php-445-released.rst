As a counterpart to PHP 5.2.1 that was released a few days ago there is
now an equivalent security release of PHP 4.4. This `addresses`_ most of the
same issues as PHP 5.2.1, but also some PHP 4.4 specific issues. I
recommend to upgrade as soon as possible to PHP 4.4.5 if you're still
using either PHP 4.3.x or PHP 4.4.y [with 0 <= y < 5]. You can
download PHP 4.4.5 from the [link
http://www.php.net/downloads.php#v4]PHP website[/link].

The PHP 4.4 branch is "maintenance" only, meaning that
releases are primarily only made for security and other important fixes.
Of course, less important fixes can also make it into the release in
case this is deemed useful.
