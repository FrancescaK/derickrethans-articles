Years ago I wrote_ about a Firefox extension that allows you to start
an Xdebug_ debugging session by clicking on an icon in Firefox' status bar.
For some unexplained reason, this extension is no longer available through
Firefox' addon-site. Although I have a copy at
http://xdebug.org/files/xdebug_helper-0.3.1-fx.xpi for archival purposes,
there are now a few other browser extensions that do the same thing.

**easy Xdebug**

`easy Xdebug`_ is an extension that serves as a replacement for the now
unavailable Xdebug helper extension. It's written by `Brecht Vanhaesebrouck`_
of eLime_. The extension was originally tested with Netbeans_ but it also seems
to work fine with Komodo_.

**Xdebug enabler**

`Xdebug enabler`_ is an extension for Google's Chrome browser. It *"allows you
to enable and disable triggering Xdebug from with in Chrome. Useful if you are
a web developer using an IDE that supports Xdebug like Eclipse with PDT."*
It's written by 'remailednet' and available through the `Google Chrome
Extensions`_ website.

**JavaScript 'enabler'**

I also ran across a `blog post`_ by 'Caleb G' from `HigherVisibility`_.
Instead of making an extension for a specific browser, he outlines two
JavaScript bookmarklets that allow you to start and stop an Xdebug_ debugging
session.

**Update:** The "Xdebug enabler" Chrome Extension seems to have some issues.
There is now also an alternative Chrome Extension called **Xdebug helper** that
integrates quite a bit better. You can find it at its `Google Chrome
Extension`_ page.
