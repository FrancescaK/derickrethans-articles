So it seems Bård and I are not going to make it to Karlsruhe tonight at
all for LinuxTag because our plane here in Norway is broken. Current
options are: use the hotel provided by KLM in Amsterdam and get the
first flight tomorrow morning to Stuttgart, or we rent a car in
Amsterdam and drive to Karlsruhe. First option means Bård will miss his
talk, the second one means that we have to drive the whole night the
full seven to eight hours to Karlsruhe... we'll see what we do later.
