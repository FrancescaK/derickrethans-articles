I was recently searching for sites that mention `Xdebug`_ and found a FireFox 2 extension
that allows you to trigger Xdebug's debugger without having to use
XDEBUG_SESSION_START as parameter. The `extension`_ works by adding the XDEBUG_SESSION cookie itself. You can configure
which IDE key it uses.

**Update:** This extension no longer exists, please refer to
http://derickrethans.nl/new-xdebug-helper.html instead.
