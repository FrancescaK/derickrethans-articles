On a rather short notice (from myself), I will be speaking the coming
Thursday at `PHP Norge`_ 's user group
meeting in Oslo on `PHP 6`_ . PHP
Norge organizes a bi-monthly gathering with once in a month a talk on a
specific topic. Attendance is free.

On a somewhat longer time frame I will be speaking at the `phplondon conference`_ . On
leap year day (February 29th) I will provide the closing keynote. In
this keynote I will go over the last 12 years of development of and *with* PHP. I will especially focus on how people perceive
development with PHP, and in the mean while share some insight knowledge
of specific events during PHP's development.
