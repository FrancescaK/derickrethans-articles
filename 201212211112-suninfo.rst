I have recently acquired a `Raspberry PI`_ and as a hacking project I am using
it as status screen in the living room. As part of this, it has a weather
widget.

I use the weather data from http://yr.no ("the Norwegians") as they provide
free_ weather data for the whole world. For each location, there is a nice `XML
file`_ with the weather forecast. 

The XML file has a forecast for several periods. See for example the first
upcoming one::

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<weatherdata>
	  …
	  <forecast>
		<tabular>
		  <time from="2012-12-21T12:00:00" to="2012-12-21T13:00:00">
			<symbol number="1" name="Fair" var="01d" />
			<precipitation value="0" />
			<windDirection deg="253.3" code="WSW" name="West-southwest" />
			<windSpeed mps="4.8" name="Gentle breeze" />
			<temperature unit="celsius" value="7" />
			<pressure unit="hPa" value="1009.8" />
		  </time>

This shows among others, the period (December 21st, 12:00 to 13:00), the symbol
to use (``number="1"``), the expected precipitation and temperature. There is a
description of what the symbols_ mean. The page is in Norwegian, but that's all
right, as I can actually read that.

For most of the symbols there is both a day and a night variant of the symbol.
And in some cases, there is also a "mørketid" variant - the period in which the
sun never comes over the horizon.

In each XML file, the coordinates of the location for which the forecast is are
also present::

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<weatherdata>
	  <location>
		<name>London</name>
		<type>Capital</type>
		<country>United Kingdom</country>
		<timezone id="Europe/London" utcoffsetMinutes="0" />
		<location altitude="21" latitude="51.50853" longitude="-0.12574" geobase="geonames" geobaseid="2643743" />
	  </location>

The location information comes from http://geonames.org, which handily also
includes the `Olson timezone ID`_ for the location. The *timezone ID* combined
with the *time*, the *latitude* and the *longitude* are enough to calculate
sunrise and sunset times with PHP's `date_sun_info()`_ function. 

For example, to find out the sunset and sunrise for today in London
(Europe/London, 51.50833°N, 0.12574°W)::

	<?php
	$result = date_sun_info( time(), 51.50853, -0.12574 );
	print_r( $result );
	?>

This returns the following array::

	Array
	(
		[sunrise] => 1356077046
		[sunset] => 1356105238
		[transit] => 1356091142
		[civil_twilight_begin] => 1356074637
		[civil_twilight_end] => 1356107647
		[nautical_twilight_begin] => 1356072046
		[nautical_twilight_end] => 1356110239
		[astronomical_twilight_begin] => 1356069597
		[astronomical_twilight_end] => 1356112687
	)

Each value is a `Unix timestamp`_. To display when the Sun rises and sets::

	<?php
	$result = date_sun_info( time(), 51.50853, -0.12574 );
	echo 'Sunrise: ', date( 'H:i', $result['sunrise'] ), ", ";
	echo 'Sunset: ', date( 'H:i', $result['sunset'] ), "\n";
	?>

Which shows (for today): ``Sunrise: 08:04, Sunset: 15:53``. The *transit* value
is the time when the Sun is at its highest point, and the different
twilight_begin/twilight_end values represent different start and end times of
the three different forms of twilight_. From the above information, it is also
trivial to calculate the length of day: ``echo $result['sunset'] -
$result['sunrise']);`` (or today in London: *28192 seconds*, which is
*7h49m52s*).

Near the summer and winter solstices_ there are regions on Earth where the Sun
never rises (the afore mentioned "mørketid") or when the Sun never sets. 
If we take for example Kirkenes in Northern Norway (69.72°N, 30.04°E), we can
calculate all the different values with::

	<?php
	date_default_timezone_set( 'Europe/Oslo' );
	$result = date_sun_info( time(), 69.72, 30.04 );
	foreach ( $result as $key => $value )
	{
		if ( gettype( $value ) == 'boolean' ) {
			echo $key, ': always ', $value ? 'above' : 'below', "\n";
		} else {
			echo $key, ': ', date( 'H:i', $value ), "\n";
		}
	}
	?>

Which shows::

	sunrise: always below
	sunset: always below
	transit: 10:58
	civil_twilight_begin: 08:48
	civil_twilight_end: 13:07
	nautical_twilight_begin: 07:03
	nautical_twilight_end: 14:53
	astronomical_twilight_begin: 05:44
	astronomical_twilight_end: 16:11

Indicating that the Sun never rises. During summer (July 22nd, 13:45 CEST), it
shows for Kirkenes::

	sunrise: always above
	sunset: always above
	transit: 12:06
	civil_twilight_begin: always above
	civil_twilight_end: always above
	nautical_twilight_begin: always above
	nautical_twilight_end: always above
	astronomical_twilight_begin: always above
	astronomical_twilight_end: always above

Which indicates that the Sun is always above the horizon.


It is important to use the correct timezone in your script, otherwise you get
weird results::

	<?php
	// Timezone for London, location for Los Angeles
	date_default_timezone_set( 'Europe/London' );
	$result = date_sun_info( time(), 34.0522, -118.2437 );
	echo 'Sunrise: ', date( 'H:i', $result['sunrise'] ), ", ";
	echo 'Transit: ', date( 'H:i', $result['transit'] ), ", ";
	echo 'Sunset: ', date( 'H:i', $result['sunset'] ), "\n";
	?>

Which then shows::

	Sunrise: 14:55, Transit: 19:51, Sunset: 00:48

Which is clearly incorrect.

Now we have figured out whether it's day, night or "mørketid" we can show the
correct symbol. With "Partly Cloudy" (symbol ``$nr = 5``) we select the symbol as
follows::

	if ( $result['sunrise'] === false || $result['sunset'] === false )
	{
		$symbol = sprintf( "%02dm", $nr );
	}
	else if ( time() > $result['sunrise'] && time() < $result['sunset'] ) )
	{
		$symbol = sprintf( "%02dd", $nr );
	}
	else
	{
		$symbol = sprintf( "%02dn", $nr );
	}

**Some last notes**

If I would have paid more attention, I would have seen in the XML file::

	<sun rise="2012-12-21T08:03:58" set="2012-12-21T15:53:39"/>

which means I wouldn't have had to calculate the sunrise and sunset.

I would also have seen the ``var="mf/01n.26"`` part of::

      <time from="2012-12-21T16:00:00" to="2012-12-21T17:00:00">
        <symbol number="1" name="Fair" var="mf/01n.26" />

which means I wouldn't have to do the ugly trick to create the correct symbol
in the first place… Of course, this article wouldn't have been as nearly as
interesting then.

**Happy Southern Solstice!**
