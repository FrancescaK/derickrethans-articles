For the `eZ components`_ we are currently writing introductionary tutorials for
each component. These tutorials should be a first start in understanding
the abilities of each specific component without having to go through
the full API documentation.

As good programmers we hate to document and thus the easier we can make
the process the better documentation we will get. For our internal
documents we use plain text files in SVN, `describing guidelines`_ and conventions. Those text files are formatted using `reStructuredText`_ ,
a format used by the Python community. It is a very easy to remember
syntax, wiki-like, and it is easy to convert to HTML. We also decided
to used the same format for our `tutorials`_ because it is such an easy format. With a `specific`_ PHP script we generate HTML from the tutorials, and add links to the
other documentation that is generated by `phpDocumentor`_ from our inline API
documentation.
