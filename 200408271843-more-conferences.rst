I'm going to speak at another `conference`_ during this fall -- `OSCOM`_ --
in Zürich, Switserland. I will have three talks at the main
conference, on `Xdebug`_ , PHP and
performance and on Multi-lingual development. Besides the
conference I will also speak at the `PHP Usergroup Meeting`_ in
Zürich the day before the conference on Regular Expressions.
