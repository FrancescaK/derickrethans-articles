I've been looking for some time for a remote control for my Nikon D70 in
order to make very long exposure times possible (> 30 secs). I know
you can buy a remote for this - but they are quite expensive. After some
more browsing around I found `a module`_ for my Palm
to act as a IR remote for the camera. Really useful and it works
great.

The above image was taken with my 55mm lens at f=4 and an exposure time
of 632 seconds. More pictures will follow later...
