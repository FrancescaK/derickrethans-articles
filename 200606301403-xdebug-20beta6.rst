I am currently in Sofia attending the `webtech`_ conference. However some of the talks are in Bulgarian which makes it
quite hard to follow. (There is translation available, but it is still
not easy). So, instead of going to the sessions I finalized some
optimization patches for `Xdebug`_ . I
managed to find and fix some performance bottlenecks with cachegrind.
Xdebug usually tries to figure out which variables are available in a
specific function's scope by iterating over the op array that is being
excuted. However, in many cases this is totally useles as the
information is never used in any way. With the patch Xdebug will only
try to figure out this information when either remote debugging is
enabled, or when the setting xdebug.show_local_vars is activated. This
speeds up certain applications by as much as 50%. This patch, and many
others, made it into Xdebug 2.0.0beta6 which I just released through
PECL. The source code is also avaible through the Xdebug website.
