We did not see many presentatons due to yesterays delays. We did
see a presentation on the oscom-project BXE, an xml editor based
on mozilla and javascript. Another presentation was about an
php-gtk client interacting with eZ publish 2.

Bård's presentation started a bit delayed due to his shitty Dell
which didn't like any of the beamers here, so he used my laptop to
access his eZ publish installation.
