I was pointed to two URLs today that relate to the political situation in the USA. The `first one`_ describes the report of a fellow photographer being
harrassed by people from the Homeland Security Deparment for making pictures and noting down
shutterspeed/aperture. The `second one`_ I find much more concerning. I will not make comments on it yet, but I would recommend to read
those two URLs yourself, and ask yourself carefully if this is really what people want (in the USA).
