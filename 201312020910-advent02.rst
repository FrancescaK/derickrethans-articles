Although OpenStreetMap_ in the United Kingdom, and specially in London, has
come along very far, it is going to be nearly impossible to keep things
up-to-date. We use a few external datasets to compare against to check for
completion, and one of those is `OS Locator`_. The fine folk at `ITO World`_
have created a comparison algorithm between OpenStreetMap and OS Locator,
which they expose through a summary_ per area and a tile-layer_ as a visual
aid.

I usually have to travel quite a bit from home to actually see a discrepancy,
but since the update to the latest data set I actually found one very close to
home: Opal Mews. On the site the discrepancy looked like:

In this case, the tag is simply missing on the way. However instead of adding
the data directly from OS Locator, a survey is required. In some cases, the
data in OS Locator is actually wrong, even though it's supposed to be an
official source. So I went past the road, checked whether the name "Opal Mews"
was visible, and added the name to OpenStreetMap:
http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/changeset/19136631

Now ITO World's OSM analysis does not have it listed as an inconsistency
anymore:
