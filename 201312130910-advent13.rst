Once in a while, the `London OpenStreetMap group`_ organises a `hack weekend`_
where a bunch of us hack on various different projects, such as the 
`new design`_, `project OSRM`_ or `using Food Hygiene Open Data`_ to improve
OpenStreetMap.

The last few that I have attended were always close to the end of the year, so
I tend to use them to make my "year of edits" videos:

 - 2012: https://vimeo.com/56374742

This year instead I focussed on creating a mapping party progress video for
the great work that the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) has been
doing for organising and mapping the destruction of Typhoon Haiyan_ in the
Philippines. There have been lots of `media coverage`_ but I wanted to show
how much they have added in the two weeks since the thyphoon hit—and what
better to do this then with a progress video.

I have made many videos before, mostly for mapping parties in London, but
also for other areas, such as Burgos_ in Spain, and for the `Carse of
Gowrie`_. At first I wanted to make them for the large area around Tacloban
but in the end it made more sense to just do a slightly smaller area:

I have used a slightly tweaked variant of my OSM progress software that you
can find on GitHub: https://github.com/derickr/osm-progress — I'll soon clean
up my changes and push them to the repository as well.
