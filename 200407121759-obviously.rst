While listening to Michael Schumachers `press conference`_ at the end of the race at Silverstone, it became
obvious that he uses the word obviously very often. Obviously that
sounds rather weird, and obviously here is atleast somebody who
needs to blog this. Yesterday he only used it 9 times though,
obviously a mistake :)
