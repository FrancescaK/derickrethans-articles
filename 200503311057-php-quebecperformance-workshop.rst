While driving back from Mont Sainte Anne, where `Marcus`_ spend two
days skiing (more about that later), Damien from `PHP Quèbec`_ asked us
to do a 3 hour workshop on PHP and Performance because another speaker was apperently not going to be in
time. Slides for this presentation are as usual on the `talks page`_ , and Marcus
has extra slides `here`_ .
