Today we look at a non-code contribution. The PHP project makes snapshots of
the current state of the Git repository available through
http://snaps.php.net. There is a two hourly cronjob that goes over all the
active branches and then builds a ``.tar.gz``, a ``.tar.bz2`` and an ``.xv``
bundle.

After the recent branching of ``PHP 5.6`` the snapshots started failing_.
I have always been involved with making the snapshots work so I had a look to
see what was wrong.

I discovered that "somebody" had use the root account to try to
fix/change/update things, but the snapshots are build under a different uses,
the ``snapbuilder`` user. With some file now having been updated by root, the
snapbuilder user was unable to read and/or write to those files anymore,
resulting in broken snapshots.

I also discovered that the directory that contains the master branch of the
code was missing altogether. I can't explain how that happened, but I
restored it by cloning a new version from the Git repository. A similar thing
I did for the PHP 5.6 branch so that we now also have snapshots for that
branch.
