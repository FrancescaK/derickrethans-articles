In two weeks I
will be heading to Toronto to speak at `php|works`_ . I will speak on several
things, perhaps the most surprising one is `The PHP Toolbox`_ , where I will actually be talking on `PEAR`_ partly when introducing how to set
up your own managable PHP Toolbox. Less surprising talks are `PHP and Unicode`_ that discusses the new Unicode features in PHP 6, and `How PHP Ticks`_ that goes into some of the inner workings of PHP. With this
talk I hope to be creating some awareness of PHP's design limitations
and features so that people can better utilize PHP.
