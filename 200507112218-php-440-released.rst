Today I spend some time finalizing and releasing PHP 4.4.0, which
address major memory corruption problems with returning references from
functions. This should fix plenty of weird crashes in larger
applications, such as `eZ publish`_ . The
full release announcement is:

The PHP Development Team would like to announce the immediate release of
PHP 4.4.0. This is a maintenance release that addresses a serious memory
corruption problem within PHP concerning references. If references were
used in a wrong way, PHP would often create memory corruptions which
would not always surface and be visible. The increased middle digit was
required because the fix that corrected the problem with references
changed PHP's internal API. PHP 4.4.0 does not have any new features,
and is solely a bugfix release.

A separate release announcement is also available. For changes in PHP
4.4.0 since PHP 4.3.11, please consult the `PHP 4 ChangeLog`_ .
