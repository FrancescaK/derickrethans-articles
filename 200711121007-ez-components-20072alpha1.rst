We've just released the first alpha version of the new eZ Components
release, for which the full version is due to be released somewhere next
month. There are two new components, but also many improvements to
existing components. The new components are:

Tree, which handles the creating, manipulating and querying of tree
structures. The component supports different storage algorithms for
optimal performance. There are two tieins for this component,
TreeDatabaseTiein, providing functionality to store tree-data in a
database, and TreePersistentObjectTiein, providing data storage in the
form of persistent objects.

Webdav, which allows you to set up and run your own WebDAV (RFC 2518)
server, to enable online content editing for the users of your system
through the WebDAV HTTP extension.
