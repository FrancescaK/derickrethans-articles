As you might know Google engineers can use 20% of their time to
work on 'personal' projects. That's how orkut started for example.
From today we also do this at `eZ systems`_ ; every friday after lunch we can use to work on
personal, though slightly relevant, projects. This gives an
opportunity to seek out some new tools and projects.
