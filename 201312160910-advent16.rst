I already wrote about comparing `OS Locator`_ data with OpenStreetMap for `day
2`_ and `day 8`_, but there are plenty of other highlights in London that I
can easily have a look at. So a certain lunch time walk brought me to the
borough of `Kensington and Chelsea`_. I first looked at `Camborne Mews`_
(which OS Locator had as Cambourne Mews) and `Cowling Close`_ (which OpenStreetMap
had as Cowling Cross).

But the more interesting thing to look at was the last one of the three.
Apostrophes are always a tricky part, both for mappers
as well as councils. I had already run into `St. Marks Road`_ `back in 2010`_
but ITO World now also flagged up St. Johns Gardens. Both segments *were* mapped
as St. John's Gardens in OpenStreetMap. OS Locator has the street as two
**different** names. For the  `western segment`_ it has *St John's Gardens*:

For the `eastern segment`_ it has *St Johns Gardens*:

These images are extracts from another comparison tool between OS Locator and
OpenStreetMap, called `OS Locator musical chairs`_, made by `Robert Scott`_.

In any case, after visiting Cowling Close slightly to the west, I came through
Clarendon Road and there on the corner with St John's Gardens, I spotted the
following sign:

Ah! So I concluded, the name of the street is St John's Gardens, with
apostrophe.

I continued along the road towards St Johns Church, and on the corner with
Lansdowne Road I found the following two signs:

Argh, both without apostrophe! On the north end around the church, on the
corner with Lansdowne Crescent, there two more signs without apostrophe
(sorry, one was too blurry to add here):

I took another photo on the corner with Ladbroke Grove but didn't pay much
attention to it and assumed it was without apostrophe as well. So with five
signs saying *St Johns Gardens* (without apostrophe) and sign with *St John's
Gardens* (with apostrophe), the street is surely just called *St Johns
Gardens*. Back home, I then edited_ OpenStreetMap to say that the name of the
streets are *St Johns Gardens* and **not** *St John's Gardens*. 

Just now, while writing the article I had a better look at the sign on the
corner with Ladbroke Grove:

And yes, there is indeed an apostropheâ€¦ What surprises me most however is that
it's really up to the council to decide the spelling of street names, and
convey that information to Ordnance Survey. Apparently, they can't make their
minds up on what to print on the signs, and what to tell Ordnance Survey
(considering they had two parts of the same street with two different names).
In any case, OpenStreetMap *maps what is on the ground*, and right now, with
three against two, *St Johns Gardens* (without apostrophe) wins.
