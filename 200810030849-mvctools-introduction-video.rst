During the last few months I've been working on the implementation of
the MvcTools `component`_ . This
component provides the functionality that can serve as foundation for a
framework. To introduce some of its concepts, I recorded a short
introduction screen cast, that you can find at `http://ezcomponents.org/resources/articles/article-2008-09-25-mvctools-vid1`_ .

In the future I would like to make more such videos - if you have an
idea for one, please let me know. All other feedback is of course
welcome too.

*Update:* I re-encoded the video, as some readers had issues with
the old one.
