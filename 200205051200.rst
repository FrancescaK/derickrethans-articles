Moving

   :Where: Groessen, The Netherlands

Moving, it's not my favorite hobby but you will almost always move to a better
location. This weekend we decided to move to our new office, with a *lot*
more space. No more crowded office, annoying people and parking problems.
Finally some lebensraum for ourselves. Now you might wonder why I used this
old german propaganda term, and that's because it's 'Liberation Day' in the
Netherlands today. We celebrate the end of the German occupation, and ofcourse
that means party!

Anyway, beside the fun parts of moving, there are also drawbacks. These are
mostly caused by other third parties, such as the company who installs your
network and internet. They made a nice patchpanel for us, but they numbered
the jacks wrong.. grrr. Anyway, they can fix it on monday. And they also need
to fix the internet connection for us. We got a nice NATted line now, and that
doesn't help much when you want a VPN from home to your office network.

I now going into heavy partying, take care!
