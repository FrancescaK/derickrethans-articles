=====================

*The PHP development team has discovered that the PHP scripting
language infringes on patent number EP0646864 (click on the
"Claims" button to see the description), granted by the European
Patent Office to Nippon Electric Co in 1995. This is a software patent
on the principle of optimising compilers. Unfortunately, it appears we
have unknowingly stolen this incredible invention and added
optimisation functionality to our compiler without asking them for a
license first.*

*Did you know that the above paragraph could turn into reality if the
European Parliament approves the proposed directive on software
patents September 1st?*

Europe, the European Patents Office (EPO) has been granting them
anyway (because they make good money doing so). Now, certain people in
the European Parliament are trying to legalise this kind of unlimited
patentability, instead of telling the EPO to respect the law!
