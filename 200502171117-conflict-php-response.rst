I actually got a response back, it reads as follows:

If you do not care to read it, and I assume you did not since you stated so. How can you insult it, if you
know nothing about it. This author gave his opinion on what he thought could be in the future of PHP. He
perceived the updates in the latest version of PHP were taking a path that was different from what the users
wanted. He even quoted a Survey that backed up this information. As far as I know we do live in a free
country where if we have an opinion we can voice it. You are also free to have your opinion. As for your
last remark, If you read the article he just states that he was concerned that Zend could be changing PHP5
to make it more of a commercial product. He even uses the fact that Zend is offering an $800 PHP plug-in for
Sun Servers, as an example. If you disagree with this article, his email is listed in his BIO so that you
can discuss this with him further.
