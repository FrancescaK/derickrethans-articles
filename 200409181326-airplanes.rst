Traveling to other places is nice, but the way on how you get
there is usually not. Here I'm sitting in cattle coach trying to
watch a movie on the laptop, but the person in front of me found
it necessary to put her seat into sleeping "mode" leaving me no room
whatsoever. I'm literally struck in between seats with my
knees firmly embedded in the seat in front of me.
