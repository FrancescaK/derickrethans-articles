Lots of things are happening in outerspace. Just yesterday the `ESA`_ had
great success with their `Huygens`_ probe and
there is also a comet - `Machholz`_ - on the horizon.

A couple of days ago I went with a friend to find this comet ... but no luck. Although our places was pretty
dark, it wasn't dark enough and we couldn't find it. I did make some photos of starry nights though with
both my analog camera on an 800 ASA film, but the photo lab screwed up and cut all my images in half :I So
no luck there. With my digicam I took some pictures too, a couple of `Orion`_ and the `Pleiades`_ . Not stunning pictures so I feel it's time to
get some real equipment now... such as a telescope and a good digicam.
