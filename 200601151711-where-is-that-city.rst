Some time ago I downloaded a large database of cities around the world,
with their geographical locations (latitude and longitude). Now that
I'm writing an article on the `eZ components`_ for `php|architect`_ I was going to demo a
small import script and a SOAP service that uses this information. But
I didn't have the vagest clue where I got this database from, and what
its license was.

What I did remember is that I read it somewhere on `planet PHP`_ and with some backtracing
I found Henri's `post`_ which lead me to the site of `MaxMind`_ . This company provides a `list of a few million cities`_ including geo-coordinates. They provide it under a
very nice `license`_ as well. In a few more days I'll be publishing the client so that you
can use this Web service as well.
