Some people who where speaking at the conference where
"rasmussed". This new verb means that some presentation speaker
drew all the audience away from other presentations being given at
the same time. This effect usually occurs when Rasmus Lerdorf is
having a presentation at the same time as another speaker has,
though this is not necessary that the person who rasmusses you is
Rasmus itself.
