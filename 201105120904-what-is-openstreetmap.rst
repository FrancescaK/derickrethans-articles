With people more and more complaining that Google Maps `gets it wrong`_, I
often reply that the complainers have a look at OpenStreetMap_ instead.  But
there are a few misunderstandings on what OpenStreetMap actually is.

OpenStreetMap has its main site at http://openstreetmap.org. This shows a
rendering of the map that we like to call a "`slippy map`_". This is an online map, that can interactively be zoomed and 
paned. The slippy map on
the site is nothing more than a display of map tiles, static images rendered from OpenStreetMap data as an example of what you can do with it.
The real power of
OpenStreetMap is not this default rendering, but the possibility to actually
access the data behind this map rendering.  And this is where it differs from
`Google maps`_, `Bing Maps`_ and `Yahoo! Maps`_ and various others.
OpenStreetMap is the only mapping service that allows you to do something more
than just look at pretty map tiles. OpenStreetMap is a database project, with
as its main purpose to have an exhaustive database of every street, city, road,
building etc on the planet, and not a map display project.

Now what does that actually mean? For one thing, it means that the sample map
tiles (that are displayed in the slippy map) are not meant to be used heavily
from applications.  It's all right to show a map tile of your neighbourhood on
your web site, but it's not okay to write a mobile application that allows you
to scrape map tiles of large areas. Have a look at the general `tile usage
policy`_ for some background.  The only reason why there is a sample rendering
is to aid mappers with improving the data that is the core of OpenStreetMap.

Obviously, the OpenStreetMap project wants its data to be used. But if you're
not allowed to use the map tiles en-masse, then how can you use the data?

First of all, you can query the OpenStreetMap database in various ways. In most
cases, you're going to get an XML file with descriptions of nodes (points of
interest, facilities such as toilets, benches, addresses), ways (roads, water
ways, transport routes) and areas (buildings, lakes). There is some more info
on the (very simple schema) here__. This data you can parse and import (as I've
shown in a previous article__) and do all kinds of cool tricks with, such as
finding out the closest pub. This functionality is not available on the main
OpenStreetMap site, because "OpenStreetMap does not aim to create and host
every webservice possible, but to provide the data so that others can"  make
awesome map-related applications.

Secondly there is a growing number of web sites that uses the OpenStreetMap
data to render specialized maps.  There is OpenCycleMap_ that renders
information related to using your bicycle and Öpvnkarte_ for public transport.
There is even a tool that uses the `postcode data`_ in OpenStreetMap.  It's
quite possible to render your own maps as well, but that I will get back to in
a later article.

MapQuest_ is a good example of a company that uses OpenStreetMap data.
They have made their own rendering with its own styles for a visually
different map. Their site implements searching__ for pubs/bars and restaurants
for example and MapQuest are also `happy with you using their map tiles`_ for your applications.
Recently, they have also announced `a simple API`_ to generate a static map
based on OpenStreetMap with their rendering style.

The map above is generated by just requesting

Another major difference with established mapping providers is the ability to
edit the map yourself. You can add your own business, houses, addresses,
postcodes, your favourite restaurants with either on-line_ or off-line_
editors. My list of recent edits is here__.

There is also a whole plethora of special renderings of the map data to assist
with debugging issues with the map.  There is the "`no name`_" rendering which
shows roads without name, `ITO World's`_ `osm analysis`_ that shows deviations
of road names from another source in the UK, keepright_ and `OSM Inspector`_
that have some automated checks and a tool to `overlay postcodes`_ for
checking.

Obviously, there are a few things missing that would make OpenStreetMap an even
better resource for mapping related applications and web-applications. Feel
free to suggest things that you find missing or lacking in the comments of this
article. I'd be happy to hear why you would think that OpenStreetMap is not a
good fit for your applications and usage.
