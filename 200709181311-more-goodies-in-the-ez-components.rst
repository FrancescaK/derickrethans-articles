We just pushed out new alpha versions of five existing components. The
changes to `Authentication`_ , `Mail`_ and `Url`_ are part of the new
features that are going to be part of the next release of the `eZ Components`_ .

In the just released alpha versions you can find new features, such as
better support for OpenID, a Database backend for OpenID authentication,
a validating method for e-mail addresses, SMTP authentication support
for DIGEST-MD5, CRAM-MD5, NTLM and LOGIN and encoding support for e-mail
headers.

Those new features, together with other feature enhancements, as well as
exciting new components such as Tree (creating, manipulating and
querying of tree structures) and WebDav, will become eZ Components
2007.2 around the end of the year. Have a look at the `roadmap`_ if you want to get a full overview.
