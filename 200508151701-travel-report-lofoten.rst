*Day 1*

We
started our trip from Bodø, a small industrial city just above the
artic circle. The city itself is not very interesting, but it does make
a nice starting point for a travel to the Lofoten, which lay a 3 hour
ferry trip away to the east. After we checked in into our hotel we drove
around a bit and ended up on mount Rønvik from where you have an
excellent view over `the city`_ and `the coast`_ .

Close to Bodø you can find `Saltstraumen`_ which has the strongest tidal current in the world. The current is at
strongest four times a day and you can only see its real power by seeing
a boat struggeling to go into the wrong direction. On our way to
Saltstraumen we passed this shed near the water, with a beautiful `reflecting in the water`_ .

*Day 2*

After staying the night in Bodø we drove around a bit more, and ended
up at the ruins of a `fortress`_ across
Bodø's harbour. Here we relaxed and kept an eye on the myriage of ships
entering and leaving `the harbour`_ .
Later on the day we took the ferry to the Lofoten. From the ferry we saw `Værøy`_ ,
the first island we were going to visit, looming up in the mist. After
arriving we "checked-in" into our rorbu, an old fishermans
cabin. Rorbua are usually cheap, but sober, cabins which people now rent
out to tourists to stay the night. We didn't say long there and
proceeded to drive around on the island to see what's happening there.

As a
typical island in the Lofoten, Værøy has `ragged peeks`_ and
steep cliffs. The island is pretty small, so we quickly saw most of it.
We decided that we wanted to see the sun rise, which meant we need to
get up in the middle of the night, well, 02:00. As the Lofoten are so
far north, we barely missed the midnight sun with 10 days or so. So, we
got up at two in the morning and drove to the west side of the island,
just to see the sun rise, just behind `this mountain`_ .
Bugger.

*Day 3*

The next day we first stopped by the shop on Værøy to buy the
necessary material (bread) for our hiking trip to Fuglefjell (bird
mountain) to see some of the wildlife on the island. We had a lovely 6
or so hour hike, and saw lots of `seaguls`_ , a
couple of `seals`_ , a few `eagles`_ and
some " `toppskarv`_ ".
As we couldn't quite walk all the way to Fuglefjell, we crossed the
island's mountain "ridge" to have a look at " `Måstad`_ ",
the abandonned fishing village. We were all sweaty when we came back
from the hike, so we decided to take a `refreshing bath`_ in the Ocean. Estimated water temperature: 15°C, estimated air
temperature: 11°C. On the same day we took the ferry to Moskenes, and
from there to Å i Lofoten where we stayed the night in another
rorbu.

*Day 4*

From Å
we drove past `Reine`_ on our way to Nusfjord, "Norways best preserved fiskevær". In
this old town they still process dried cod, by hanging them `out to dry`_ in
the strong winds. They make a whole fuss about this there, and although
it's worthwhile having a look, you shouldn't get overexcited. Our
sleeping `place`_ was in
Kabelvåg, 5 minutes south of Svolvær.

*Day 5*

We
decided to stay one more day in Svolvær to climb to `Svolværgeita`_ , a
famous rock formation. As we didn't have proper climbing gear, nor the
experience to climb at all, we instead hiked to the backside of the
formation, where we took a picture of Svolværgeita with Svolvær in the
background.

The view was `magnificant`_ from there. Too bad the weather wasn't a bit better as we got some rain,
but that's to expect when you go to the Lofoten.

*Day 6*

From
Svolvær we continued our trip to Andenes on Andøya, which is not part
of the Lofoten, but of another archipelago, the Vesterålen. Unlike the
Lofoten the island of the Vesterålen are not littered with mountains,
instead there are a lot of `plains and lakes`_ . Andenes is a very small town, with besides it's `lighthouse`_ ,
seemingly only one major attraction: whale safari. We wanted to do that
the next day, but as the weather would get worse, we instead went almost
straight away in the evening. The temparature was still only 10°C so we
put on a lot of warm clothes (I used 5 layers) and got our photo gear as
we wanted to put those whales on the picture ofcourse. We had a lot of
luck as it wasn't very windy, so the sea was quite calm. After an hour
steeming we approached the area where the whales appear. At this place
the continental sheft `abruptly`_ ends making it an ideal place to see `sperm whales`_ and
minke whales. We were quite lucky and saw 3 sperm whales and a minke
whale. Unfortunately the latter one had also some `whalers`_ on its
tail.

*Day 7*

After
the great whale safari it was time to start on our way back to Bodø,
but we did that in two days as it was quite a long drive. The first part
of the leg went to Lødingen, a very small town, but close to the ferry
that would bring us all the way back to Bodø. As we were a bit early,
we decided to drive to Harstad to do well... get dinner. Harstad is
pretty boring, and so is Lødingen. But atleast in Lødingen you can
rest.

*Day 8*

On the last day we drove back to Bodø from where we took the plane back
to Sandefjord. On the first leg the plane actually stopped in another
place before continuing to Trondheim. First time that happened to me. We
made it safely back home after this wonderful trip.
