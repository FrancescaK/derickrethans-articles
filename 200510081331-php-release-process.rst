In the past there have been some issues with certain larger projects
that stopped working when their users upgraded their PHP versions. In
order to streamline things a bit the PHP QA team `embarked`_ on an effort to
make those projects take part in the PHP release process. Besides lists
of `projects`_ we are also making sure that the `Release Process`_ itself is also more consistent, which should help with a
more stable PHP in the end. The lists of projects are not finished yet,
if you are a lead on a project which is interested in participating,
please write an e-mail to `php-qa@lists.php.net`_ .
