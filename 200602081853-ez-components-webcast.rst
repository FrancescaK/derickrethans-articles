In about a weeks time I am going to give a `webcast`_ on
the `eZ components`_ .

In this one-hour event, I will introduce the components and discuss its
design philosophy, its strong points, as well as show practical
examples of components at work. This sponsored (by `eZ`_ ) webcast is organized by `php|architect`_ and will take place on
the 17th at 19:00 CET (18:00 GMT, 13:00 EST). If you're interested in
this (free) webcast, sign up at the `web site`_ .
