Tomorrow evening I will be presenting on `Migrating from PHP 4 to PHP5`_ as part of php|architect's `php|symphony`_ series. In this live on-line session I will talk about PHP 5's new
object model, features and incompatibilities. Although this is an
on-line session, you will still be able to listen to my voice, ask
questions just as I was sitting in your room (except that you can't see
me). It should be a truly interesting experience, also for me as I never
did something like this before. You can still sign up! See you tomorrow
(10:00 PST, 13:00 EST, 17:00 GMT, 19:00 CEST)!

Update! Times where wrong...
