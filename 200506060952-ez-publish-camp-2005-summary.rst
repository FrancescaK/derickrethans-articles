The last couple of days `eZ systems`_ had
their third `Summer Camp`_ at
Gaustablikk. The Camp is meant for users, partners and interested people
to gather information about eZ publish, discuss things together and
socialize.

When we arrived at the `Gaustablikk Høyfjellshotell`_ (Norwegian) we went straight for dinner. After
this great dinner the socializing started.

The conference itself started on the next day, Friday June 3rd. Frederik
and Alexander introduced `eZ publish 3.6`_ and our new network product that we will be releasing
later this year. After the introduction three simultaneous tracks
started with different talks. All talks where fairly short - and thus to
the point. After my own talk on Enterprise Hosting - dealing with
Clustering and our new `Static Cache`_ - I visited Vidar's session on "Making Money on eZ
publish". In this session Vidar spoke about ways for partners to
increase their income flow. Bård's session with eZ publish tips and
tricks followed with little tips that nobody thought about
before.

Bjørn Dieding from `Xrow`_ presented on
their SVN plugin for eZ publish and the `content server`_ . Tony Wood from `Vision WT`_ closed the day with a talk on "Multi-Lingual Tips and
Tricks".

The second day of the conference was dedicated to community discussions.
Here we discussed wanted features by customers, the `eZUS edu usergroup`_ and other things. After this full and fun day of
discussions we relaxed some and had again an excellent dinner. Some
discussions continued into the (very) late hours of
Saturday.

On Sunday everybody returned home, although some people finally tried to
make it to the top of Gaustablikk. Pictures of the entire event can be
found `here`_ .
