While looking over Calls for Presenters (CfPs) of different conferences I notice one interesting thing. It
seems to me that small, local, non-profit conferences such as the `PHP Konferencia`_ in Budapest make no problems of reimbursing full
travel and lodging costs for speakers, but heavily commercial conferences such as `OSCON`_ and `Zend's new conference`_ seem to be willing to pay as little as
possible. It strikes me as odd - as most open source contributors do not have the means to be a speaker at
those conferences now.
