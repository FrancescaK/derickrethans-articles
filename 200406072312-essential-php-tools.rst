A few weeks ago I received David Sklar's book 'Essential PHP
Tools' with the request to review it as it has some chapters on
programs that I wrote.

Chapter 11 deals
with understanding PHP internals and features `VLD`_ . With VLD examples showing op-codes are
made to provide a better insight into how PHP works.

Chapter 12 totally deals with (version 1.3.0) of `Xdebug`_ . First the tracing and
profiling features are explained and at last the remote debugging
features. Because most of there features are changed in the
current development version, a 2nd edition will have to be updated
drastically.
