I just published `Xdebug 2.0.0RC4`_ ,
which fixes a lot of bugs and also changes some behavior. There are two
major changes that needs some introduction. The first one is that the
profiler_output_name and trace_output_name settings no longer accept
simple values such as "crc32", but instead now accept
different format specifiers, very similar to `printf`_ () and `strftime`_ () modifiers. This will
show up in the `newly organized documentation`_ very soon as well.
