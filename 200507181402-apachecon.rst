Tomorrow I'll be traveling to Stuttgart to speak at `ApacheCon Europe`_ . I
will have two presentations, one on "Localization and
Internationalization" and another one on the improved Date &
Time support in PHP 5.1.1. I hope I don't have as much problems going to
Stuttgart as `Ken`_ or `myself last time`_ .

Presentation slides will be online at the `talks page`_ as soon as the presentations are done.
