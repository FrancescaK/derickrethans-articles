As you might have noticed I changed something in the layout of this site: photography on the right, and
coding/rants on the left. Besides this change, I also got rid of my ugly permalinks and instead I now
generate nice URLs with the `transliteration`_ extension. This turns blurb
titles as "PIC vs. non-PIC, take #2" into the URL friendly format "pic_vs_nonpic_take_2". I also use filters
to normalize ligatures (รฅ to aa) and to remove diacritical signs (รง to c).
