On Saturday I will be giving a presentation on `Test-Driven Development`_ at the `Dutch PHP Conference`_ (site in Dutch).

During the talk I will introduce the test-driven development model that
we also use while developing the `eZ Components`_ . As this talk is
slotted as a keynote I will not be going into the depths of Unit
Testing, but rather focus on development method, including the pros and
cons.

Hope to see you there!
