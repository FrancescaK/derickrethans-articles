Like `Rob Allen`_ , I don't really understand these tagged memes either,
however, after he said such nice things about me, I thought I'd have a
go.

Seven things you may not know about me:

- The first thing I did with PHP was crawling websites for e-mail
  addresses and sending spam.

- I have three years of dancing lessons.

- I have never seen `Aurora`_ .

- I know more about date/time stuff than you can ever imagine.

- My favourite sport is skiing.

- I started writing `Xdebug`_ as an accident.

- I like cooking and drinking.

I then get to pass on the baton to:

- `Pierre Joye`_ because he tries to make Windows work with PHP.

- `Elizabeth Smith`_ because she does evil things to PHP.

- `Zoë Slattery`_ because she tries to make PHP awesomer by writing tests.

- `Sebastian Bergmann`_ because he tries to get us to write better code by requiring tests.

- `Stefan Esser`_ because he still wants to have a more secure PHP if he's really honest.

- `Kore Nordmann`_ because he does very `crazy`_  `things`_ with PHP.

- `Scott MacVicar`_ because he's been naughty, and because he's a good friend.

These are the rules apparently:

- Link your original tagger(s), and list these rules on your blog.

- Share seven facts about yourself in the post - some random, some wierd.

- Tag seven people at the end of your post by leaving their names and the links to their blogs.

- Let them know they've been tagged by leaving a comment on their blogs and/or Twitter.
