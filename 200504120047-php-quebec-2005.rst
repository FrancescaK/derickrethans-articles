It has already been a week since I got back from the `PHP Québec`_ conference. I am
simply too busy to keep my blog updated.

The conference was - just like previous years - well organized and I
think that attendees got a versatile program to chose from. Before the
conference `Marcus`_ and I went
on a two day skiing trip to Monte Sainte Anne. The skiing area is pretty
large there with more than 50 pistes. We were at the end of the season
which means that the pistes were quite empty too and the sun was shining
well - which makes for excellent skiing although the snow was a bit slow
due to the sun.

The way back from Montréal was long, and I had a one and a half hour
delay when leaving because first the wrong luggage was loaded into the
plane, second because the correctly loaded luggage made the plane
off-balanced and third because we had a "medical emergency".
We were about 40 minutes late in Amsterdam where I had to wait another 6
hours for my connecting flight to `Torp/Sandefjord`_ . I was pretty happy when I
got home finally after 18 hours of travel.
