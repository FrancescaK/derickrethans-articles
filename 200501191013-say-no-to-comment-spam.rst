Through `Christian`_ :
Comment spam sucks, and a couple of search engines are now following `Google's idea`_ to make it harder for content spammers to use your site as link pool to get higher on the search page
results. I already changed my form, though I rarely get any content spam because of my JavaScript pop-up
window for it.
