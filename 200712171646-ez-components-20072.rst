Today we released
the next version of `eZ Components`_ . In this release, there are two new components.

*Tree* : This component enables you to create, manipulate and query
tree structures. There are several back-ends available, each with
different performance-related properties. There are two tie-ins for this
extension: TreeDatabaseTiein stores tree structures in a database
(recommended) and TreePersistentObjectTiein enables you to store the
data belonging to the tree structure as a persistent object.

*Webdav* : The Webdav component enables you to easily set up a
WebDAV-enabled HTTP server. Users can then create and edit site content
by uploading and downloading files to and from their desktop. The
current implementation is compatible with RFC 2518. It also supports
clients that do not conform to the standard and provides an interface to
support these clients. This component does not have any other
dependencies besides PHP (and the required extensions), nor does it
require any Apache modules.
