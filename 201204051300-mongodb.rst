As of today I am working for 10gen_, the company behind MongoDB_. I have been
contracting with them for a few months to work on the PHP driver_ for MongoDB.
I am now making the switch to a full time position.

I am responsible for supporting MongoDB in the PHP ecosystem through driver
development, integration with open source tools, community support, and
developer advocacy. For now, I will concentrate to get the driver into
a better shape, and speaking about MongoDB and PHP.

I have already given a few talks_ on the subject, and if you would like me to
speak at your user group or conference, please let me know_. If you have any
comments on using MongoDB with PHP, I would love to hear them too.

I am looking forwards with the awesome team at 10gen. Both with team in London,
as well as with the folks in Palo Alto, New York and Dublin. 10gen is also
hiring a few more people for a similar position in New York and Palo Alto. Have
a look at the job posting here_ if you are interested.
