So our luggage actually did arrive yesterday night, around 1 in the
morning which is a good thing. Today is LAMP day at `LinuxTag`_ ,
where there is a whole day of talks related to `LAMP`_ . I did a talk on
migrating PHP 4 to PHP 5 for which I'll put the slides online of later
when I've some more time.
